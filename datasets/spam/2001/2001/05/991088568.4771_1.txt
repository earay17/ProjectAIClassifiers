Subject: Boost Your Windows Reliability!

<html>
<body>

<p>Dear Windows User,<br>
<br>
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 95, 98 and ME to nearly
the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and industrial 
version
of Windows.<br>
<br>
The new WinFix is a very effective way to improve the reliability of Windows,
because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing.<br>
<br>
And WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of 
Windows.<br>
<br>
<u><font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://topman.buddybistro.com/">CLICK 
HERE</a></font></u> to find out more about WinFix, the safest, most effective 
way to keep you working, by keeping your PC working non-stop.<br>
