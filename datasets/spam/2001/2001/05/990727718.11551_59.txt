If you are Canadian, you should register your canadian internet domain name as soon as possible.  By securing your own .CA domain name, Internet users from around the world will be able to recognize that you are Canadian.  In the past, .CA names were not readily available to the public as there were many restrictions as to who can register.  However, recent regulatory changes have since made .CA registrations easily available.  Registrations for .CA domain names are now open for any business or individual residing in Canada.  Since there can only be one registrant per unique .CA name, thousands of Canadians businesses and individuals are rushing to reserve their .CA name before it's taken.  

Registration is on a first come, first served basis and costs only CAN$29.95 per name.  You can secure your Canadian now by at the following website: http://www.RegisterInCanada.com
