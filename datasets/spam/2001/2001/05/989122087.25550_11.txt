Hi,

If you own an Inkjet printer, Laser printer, or Copy machine you owe it to your self to take 5 minutes of your time to read what I have to say.

Most inkjet replacement cartridges cost around $25 each or more.  The average Laser printer or copy machine toner cartridge cost around $150.  Some of the less expensive ones go for around $65, all the way up to over $300 each.

Bottom Line:  

I am not going to spend a lot of time telling you why you should do business with our company.  We offer 3 ways for you to save money on your printing needs.

1. We offer premium quality inkjet refill kits tailored to your specific printer cartridges to ensure premium print quality.  Our refill kits can save you over 70% compared to purchasing new cartridges every time you run out of ink.


2. We offer new replacement cartridges for most major brands of inkjet printers at up to 50% less than you would pay in the store if you do not wish to do the refilling yourself. 

3.   We offer laser printer and copier toner service that can save you over 50% on                                                                          
     Your toner needs.  It works like this.  You send us your empty toner cartridge and  
     We refill it with premium toner and send it back to you ready to use at half what   
     You would pay at the store.

All of our ink and tone is premium quality and manufactured in the USA.  We guarantee our products will print to your liking or your money back.
