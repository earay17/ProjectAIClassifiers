New MasterCard/Visa eCommerce Regulations 

Get Real-Time, or face stiff fines. Non-Compliance fines 
$1,000 to $25,000 per month

Visa has published their definition of an electronic 
commerce transaction to include "...a transaction conducted 
over the Internet or other network using a cardholder access 
device, such as a personal computer or terminal," according 
to a recent Visa memo.

Being in compliance will include processing all transactions
considered "electronic" by using an approved "real-time" 
gateway, rather than software such as PC Authorize, IC Verify,
PC Charge or other modem based credit card processing
solutions.
