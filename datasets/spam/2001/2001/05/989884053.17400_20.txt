 ATTN.: THE MANAGING DIRECTOR / CEO.

Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT (CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
OF THE TRANSFER OF US$45,560,000.00 (FORTY-FIVE
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES
DOLLARS ONLY).

I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we
have not had any previous communication.  I got your
reference from the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council
(NEPC) and went further to have it confirmed by your
country’s trade department under private inquiry that
is not related to my aim of writing you this letter.

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different
Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals
decided to solicit your assistance as regards the
transfer of the above stated amount into your bank
account.  This fund arose from the over-invoicing of
various contracts awarded in my parastatals to certain
foreign contractors some time ago.

We as holders of official positions in various
parastatals, were mandated by this new civilian
government to scrutinize all payments made to certain
foreign contractors by the past military government
and we discovered that some of the contracts they
executed were grossly over-invoiced, either by
omission or commission.  Also we discovered that the
sum of US$65,560,000.00 (Sixty-Five Million, Five
Hundred and Sixty Thousand United States Dollars Only)
was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign
contractors were fully paid their entitlements after
executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that the over-invoiced amount be
transferred (for our own use) into a bank account
provided by a foreign partner, as the code of conduct
of the Federal Civil Service does not allow us to
operate foreign accounts.

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of
these money, precisely US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty
Million United States Dollars Only) into a foreign
account in GENEVA (SWITZERLAND) last week.  But
unfortunately, the provider of the account has severed
all forms of contacts with us as he has refused to
adhere to our earlier mutual agreement insisting that
the total amount be paid into his nominated bank
account before disbursement will take effect.  If for
US$20M (Twenty Million United States Dollars Only) we
are not compensated, how can one guarantee full
compensation on remittance of the balance of
US$45.560M (Forty-Five Million, Five Hundred and Sixty
Thousand United States Dollars Only).

We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the
balance amount of US$45.560M, which can be speedily
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank
account.  On successful remittance of the fund into
your account, you will be compensated with 25% of the
amount for assistance and services and 5% set aside
for expenses contingency.

This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our
SENSITIVE POSITION we cannot afford a slip, I assure
you that this transaction is 100% risk free.  We will
avail you with our identities as regards our
respective offices, when relationship is fully
established and smooth operation commences.

I am at your disposition to entertain any question(s)
from you in respect of this transaction, so contact me
immediately through this email address only
(alh_tankodangote@presidency.com ) for further
information on the requirements and procedure.

Please note that the DEAL needs utmost confidentiality
and your immediate response by sending us your private
telephone and fax numbers respectively will be highly
appreciated and we will use our own share of the money
to establish a lucrative firm in your country.

Yours truly,


ALHAJI TANKO DANGOTE.
