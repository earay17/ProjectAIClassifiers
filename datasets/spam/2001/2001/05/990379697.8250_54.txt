Finally! $69.95/ month flat rate long distance 
from a real phone company! 24/7 - It works. 
This is phone to phone service over the fiber optic network.
No special equipment needed. Includes all 50 states,
(including in-state toll calls), 3 way calling, conference calling, 
No gimmicks, No need to change long distance carriers, 
No set-up fees, No credit checks, No long term contracts. 
DISTRIBUTORS NEEDED! Our people are already making over $10,000.00/month working from home. No fee to become a distributor. Call my home-office anytime:  972-480-5239

Disclaimer: 
I am looking for motivated marketers or
people seriously interested in the service. 
The reason why I did not use my regular 
800 number is because I want to do business
only with serious and interested people. If you
will take the time and the money to call a long 
distance number, I automatically know that you 
are serious!
