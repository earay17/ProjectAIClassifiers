(ask for more examples from admissions):

Mark Mentzer says: 
"When I enrolled at The University I had little skills
in the web process. Now six months later they are providing
me with site work where I have earned from $400-$1000
in a 2-4 day period!  I've built a valuable portfolio that
I can market to potential clients or employees.  This school
was a big break for me."

Jennifer Den Adel said: 
"The staff at The University has been great.
In fact, I started out as an intern, and through this
past year I've found flexible hours, an invaluable
work experience, and the ability to earn a great income.
The School has opened the doors for me!"

Paul Luecke mentioned: 
"With the fantastic program at this school, I was able to pay for
my training in about two weeks worth of work for their clients! 
To learn this skill was great....but to have a program where the
University basically paid me to learn was unbelievable!"

After your graduation you also receive ADDITIONAL HOSTING SPACE
FOR YOUR CLIENTS at next-to-cost pricing! This is a direct profit
center for YOU, the web designer, resulting from your clients
