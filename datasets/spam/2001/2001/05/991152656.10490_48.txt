<p><b><font color=3D"#FF00FF" size=3D"4">THE SCALE MOVED!!!</font></b><br>
<br>
Hello! My name is Nicole Turner and I would like to share my experience as=
 an inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope.<br>
<br>
It=FFFFFF92s amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that yo=
u simply don=FFFFFF92t want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight p=
roblem for the better part of a decade.<br>
<br>
My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the refrig=
erator.<br>
<br>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked=
 At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or ener=
gy to respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder =FFFFFF97 =
If that thin, sexy, woman, in that short black dress =FFFFFF97 was really =
me? (My husband proposed to me in that dress 10 years ago) I didn=FFFFFF92=
t even feel like that happy woman in the picture =FFFFFF96 I was exhausted=
 and so depressed.<br>
<br>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I wa=
s too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I=
 was tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day.<br>
<br>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting "care=
er. " Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, &amp; even Phen-Ph=
en, and the list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few days, then=
 it was only a matter of time until I reached my breaking point and ended =
up eating vast quantities of the very foods I=FFFFFF92d been denying mysel=
f. NOTHING worked for me until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try a=
 product that was nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That produ=
ct was called
<b><font color=3D"#FF0000"> BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b>.<br>
<br>
After about five days on BerryTrim Plus, I began to experience a sense of =
"well being" with increased energy - I didn=FFFFFF92t feel tired, irritabl=
e or sluggish. More Importantly, I didn't feel Hungry - something I hadn't=
 felt for months, maybe years.<br>
<br>
I've been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought I had =
tried<br>
everything when...<br>
<br>
The Scale Moved!! I mean, really Moved! .<br>
<br>
I lost 126 pounds in 6 months.<br>
Within 6 months I dropped down to 156 pounds.<br>
<br>
Today, I can do many activities that I couldn't when I weighed 282 pounds.=
 The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was! My doctor has examine=
d me, and my weight loss has blown his mind! People that I used to work wi=
th and even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas! I truly wish =
everyone who is overweight knew about this program ... I plan to tell ever=
yone I can who has struggled with his or her weight, like I have. I can fe=
el your pain, believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the BerryTrim Plus prog=
ram! It has given me a new lease on life=FFFFFF85 After losing 126 pounds =
so far, I feel very confident, happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I recently wo=
re that same black cocktail dress I wore when my husband proposed - 10 yea=
rs ago! (I guess that woman in the picture really was me!) I thought I wou=
ld never look and feel like that again!<br>
<br>
<b><font color=3D"#FF0000">BERRY TRIM PLUS</font></b> is a powerful gift f=
rom nature that has touched every aspect of my life! And from the bottom o=
f my heart, I will always thank my dear friend Judy for telling me about t=
his wonderful product and giving me back the joy of living.<br>
<br>
IF I COULD DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT TOO!<br>
<br>
I was sick of being fat. I didn=FFFFFF92t like the way I looked and I didn=
=FFFFFF92t like the way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my fo=
ur children,and myself to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you nee=
d to lose a few pounds, more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, clic=
k through this website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing produc=
t has done for so many people like you and me!.The proof is in the pudding=
 (so to speak) so take a look at the many success stories from others who =
have gained better health, improved their relationships, and of course, lo=
st weight and are keeping it off for good. The testimonials speak for them=
selves. And if you decide this is something you are willing to try =FFFFFF=
97 GO FOR IT!!!!! You won't be sorry.. Do take the time to read them. Many=
 are simply AMAZING!<br>
