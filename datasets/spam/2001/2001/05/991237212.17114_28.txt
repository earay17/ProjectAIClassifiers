Why we're "IN THE NEWS" Every gambler knows that the house always wins in the long run. 
As Steve Wynn once famously said, "the only way to make money in a casino is to own one" 
 
"I made $73,589.00 in my first 6 months, and will double that this time around" J.Barnes, Norfolk, VA 
 
"We believe our projections of Internet gambling revenues of $100 to $200 Billion domestically and 
$200-$400 Billion in the rest of the world is reasonable, even conservative." The Baker Report
 
"We didn't realize how many people in our area gambled on-line until we received our first check for 
$39,789.54" Steve Rhodes, PA. 
 
"As an entertainer, I look at the Internet as the future venue for many forms of entertainment. It is a 
powerful way to bring fun and safe entertainment to millions of people at the same time."  
Country Singer and online casino owner, Kenny Rogers 
 
"I was amazed at the number of friends and family that are playing on my Casino, last month I earned over $11,400" 
Dave P. IL 
 
"There's no doubt you are dealing with hundreds of Billions of dollars... the amount of money we're talking 
is astronomical." -Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle on Internet gambling 
 
"I have over 500 players a month at my casino right now and I am already starting your 65% program" MD. WI. 
 
"Net traffic is doubling every 100 days." U.S. Commerce Department 
 
"On-line gambling turnovers have the potential to dwarf those of other interactive services, tapping into an existing 
traditional gambling market valued at over $700 Billion in Europe alone." Data monitor, a market analyst corporation.
 
PC Computing Magazine has conservatively estimated that the US Internet gaming market could soon reach $20 billion 
in annual revenue.
