<p>Judgment Courses offers an extensive Audio training
<br>course in <font color="blue"><b>"How to Collect Money Judgments".</b></font>
<p>If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
<br>Money Judgment is and <font color="blue"><b>why processing Money Judgments
<br>can earn you very substantial income .</b></font>
<p>If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
<br>will have a Money Judgment against them.
<p>You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
<br>shocking fact: "Its now up to you to collect on the
<br>Judgment". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
<br>The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
<br>down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
<br>real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
<p>Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
<br>when they are found. The result is that millions of
<br>Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
<p>"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime."
<p>The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
<br>proportions. Right now in the United States there is between 
<br><font color="blue"><b>200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected
<br>Money Judgment debt.</b></font>
<br>For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more Judgments take its place.
<p>We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
<br>actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
<br>business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
<br>profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
<br>techniques necessary to succeed.
<p>With our first hand experience we have built a course which
<br>teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
<br>and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
<p>By following the steps laid out in our course and with
<br>reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
<br>processing of Money Judgments.
<p>The income potential is substantial in this profession. 
<br><font color="blue">We have associates who have taken our course and are now
<br>working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
<br>year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
<br>and $100,000.00 per year.</font> Some choose to operate out of
<br>their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
<br>organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices.
<p>Today our company and our associates have over 126
<br>million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
<br>processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
<br>of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
<br>Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
<br>even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
<br>the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
<br>capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
<br>officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
<br>for reports.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
<br>force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
<br>Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
<br>refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
<br>interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
<br>Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
<br>$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
<br>payment of the principal.
<p>Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
<br>year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
<br>and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
<br>add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
<br>sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
<br>an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
<br>their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
<p><b><font color="blue">92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 
<br>43% are women and 36% are part time.</font></b>
<p>One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
<br>not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
<br>for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
<br>working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
<br>are still in force, they do not disappear.
<p>The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
<br>computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
<br>never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
<br>are. You are not a collection agency.
<p>Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
<br>are as follows:
<p>Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
<br>with Money Judgments. 
<br>(We train you how to find out who to write to)
<p>8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
<br>and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
<br>unless you want to.
<p>You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
<br>sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
<br>50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
<br>$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
<p>You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
<br>and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
<br>assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
<br>credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
<br>locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
<br>The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
<br>1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
<br>$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
<br>companies charge $25.00.
<p>Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
<br>garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
<br>(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
<br>course)
<p>When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
<br>the original Judgment holder.
<p>Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
<br>Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
<p>Quote's from several of our students:
<p>Thomas in area code 516 writes us: "I just wanted to drop
<br>you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
<br><b><font color="blue">My first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars.</font></b>
<br>Your professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
<br>doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
<br>Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
<br>judgments he is working on.
<p>After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
<br>area code 314 stated to us: 
<br><b><font color="blue">" I am now making $2,000.00 per week</font></b> and expect 
<br>this to grow to twice this amount within the next year. 
<br>I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in judgments
<br>I am collecting on now."
<p>After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
<br><b><font color="blue">" I am now making $12,000.00 per month</font></b> and have 
<br>approximately $500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on.
<br>Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out"
<p>Marshal in area code 407 states to us "I feel bad, you only
<br>charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
<br>have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
<br>your course for 5 months"
<p>>From the above information and actual results you can see
<br>why we can state the following:
<p>With our course you can own your own successful business.
<br>A business which earns you substantial income now and one
<br>which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
<br>retire on and travel the world. A business which is
<br>extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
<br>day is new and exciting.
<p>None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
<br>Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
<br>Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
<br>your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
<br>time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
<br>others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
<br>control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
<br>for many others already. Make it happen for you!
<p>If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
<br>to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
<br>on your part.
<p><b><font color="blue">Please call us at</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-4 0 6--6 5 2--0 1 9 4 .</b>
<p>We have Customer Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
<br>9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week . If you call this number

<br>Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
<br>of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
<br>you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
<br>read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
