described it as follows -(page 132)  "John's got his 
work cut out for him with Bill who is in his 40's, 
balding, wears glasses and sports an illadvised goatee."  
Yet Penthouse  goes on to say that Bill, using John 
Eagan's techniques, (page 133) "obtained 3 women's 
phone numbers that night."

interns were the ugliest guys he could find.  John 
Eagan had to coach the interns with his techniques 
by speaking into the interns ear pieces.  Using John 
Eagan's techniques, these interns got dates with 
beautiful girls.  Howard said "This guy is no bull, 
I've seen him in action.  He's the real deal."  For
