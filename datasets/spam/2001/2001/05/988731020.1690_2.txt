    1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is too perfect. For example: sun, stars, moon, air,
    earth, food, life, and water. If you threw a block of metal on the ground, would it form a
    watch and start ticking?<br>
    <br>
    2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of body experiences: Good people see the same Heaven and
    ungodly people fall down the same dark hole.<br>
    <br>
    3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Padre Pio had a stigmata that doctors and scientists determined
    to be supernaturally imposed (not self-inflected). One month before he died his wounds
    healed and left no scar. Note: Jesus saves (not what church you go to).<br>
    <br>
    4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statues of Mother Mary that doctors and scientists determined
    cry human tears. Note: Jesus saves (not the statue).<br>
    <br>
    5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world calendar system is based on Jesus&#146; life (B.C.-
    Before Christ). Could one man have fooled the whole world?<br>
    <br>
    6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible and Jesus said that he would be killed. Jesus did not
    back out, even when offered the opportunity by Pilate to deny being the Christ and be set
    free. What glory would it be for a man to be Christ if he&#146;s dead.<br>
    <br>
    7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statues of Jesus and Mother Mary that stay standing in towns
    that have been destroyed by hurricanes and earthquakes.<br>
    <br>
    8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foot prints of God. The Bible is coded with sentences using
    Jesus&#146; name before He was born. No man knew the Christ&#146;s name would be Jesus or
    how to code this type of information. No other religious book has coded information like
    this in it.<br>
    <br>
    9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Center of the Bible was created by God before the Bible was
    completed.<br>
    <br>
    10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exorcisms are performed all over the world using the power of
    Jesus Christ. No other religion besides Christianity can do that.

    Here's some little known Bible facts our parish librarian and I came across. This is
    interesting and unique.<br>
    <br>
    What is the shortest chapter in the Bible?<br>
    Answer - Psalm 117.<br>
    <br>
    What is the longest chapter in the Bible?<br>
    Answer - Psalm 119.<br>
    <br>
    Which chapter is in the center of the Bible?<br>
    Answer - Psalm 118.<br>
    <br>
    Fact: There are 594 chapters before Psalm 118.<br>
    <br>
    Fact: There are 594 chapters after Psalm 118.<br>
    <br>
    Add these numbers up and you get 1188.<br>
    <br>
    What is the center verse in the Bible?<br>
    Answer - Psalm 118:8.<br>
    <br>
    1) NOTE: THIS BOOK OF PSALMS WAS WRITTEN BEFORE ALL THE BOOKS THAT CAME AFTER IT. THAT
    MEANS THAT GOD KNEW THIS WOULD BE THE CENTER BEFORE THE BIBLE WAS COMPLETED.<br>
    <br>
    2) IF YOU HAVE THREE BOOKS, LONGEST (119), SHORTEST (117), WHAT DO YOU HAVE LEFT? MIDDLE
    OR CENTER (118). THIS ALSO POINTS OUT THAT GOD INTENDED THIS TO BE THE CENTER.<br>
    <br>
    3) ALSO IF ANY BOOK, CHAPTER, OR VERSE WERE REMOVED FROM THE BIBLE THEN 118 AND 118:8
    WOULD NOT BE THE CENTER. THAT MEANS THE WHOLE BIBLE IS <strong>TRULY GOD'S WORD</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    Does this verse say something significant about God's perfect will for our lives?&nbsp; We
    could summarize the whole Bible in this one sentence. The next time someone says they
    would like to find God's perfect will for their lives and that they want to be in the
    center of His will, just send them to the center of His Word:<br>

    God told Adam that if he ate from the Tree of Conscience (known as the apple tree), death
    and sin would be introduced. When Adam ate from the tree God allowed his promise to be
    fulfilled. God did not want us to have this curse, but if He did not keep the promise He
    would be a liar. God does not lie. God (just like a great lawyer) found a loop-hole in the
    system. God took the sinless Christ and poured into him our sins. Then in exchange poured
    His goodness into us. All who believe in Jesus have death and sin removed and are promised
    eternal life in Heaven.<br>

    href="mailto:christislordforever@yahoo.com?SUBJECT=Please"><font color="#0000FF">THE ART OF PRAYING</font></a><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
    Try to use some of these tools when praying.<br>
    <br>
    1) Forgive--God forgave us. Why should he grant our prayer if we hold anger and hate in
    our hearts? Let go of this and know that if someone did you wrong, they will be judged,
    but don't wish that on them. Instead ask God to forgive them and let them into heaven with
    you.<br>
    <br>
    2) Heard--know that all prayers are heard.<br>
    <br>
    3) Help--all prayers help. We may not understand why some prayers seem to be unanswered
    but know that they all help and we will understand everything later.<br>
    <br>
    4) Comfortable--if you&#146;re in pain while praying (like long term kneeling) offer up
    the pain to God and he will love you for that. But, praying doesn't always need to be a
    painful experience. Try praying lying down sometimes and maybe Jesus will give you a big
    hug.<br>
    Sometimes the pain takes your mind off the prayer. Talking to God is beautiful and we
    should look forward to it. When you&#146;re in love do you want to be in pain when you hug
    each other?<br>
    <br>
    5) Love--know that God loves you more than you could ever imagine. Try to offer love back
    to him when you&#146;re praying.<br>
    <br>
    6) God&#146;s will--don&#146;t pray for things that are obviously outside of Gods will.<br>
    <br>
    7) Fasting--sometimes may be needed to add to prayer power.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Arial" size="2">8) Forgive Yourself - Ask Jesus to
      forgive you of your sin.&nbsp; You should be sorry and have the intention
      of trying not to make the same sin again.&nbsp; Then let it go, Jesus has
      forgiven you.&nbsp; Don't live in guilt thinking about past sin that has
      already been forgiven.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">
