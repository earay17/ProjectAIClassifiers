3. Building Your Dream Home, Part 1: Selecting a Home Plan

Searching for your home plan is an excellent starting point! If land has already been purchased, you want to make sure that the plan you are searching for will fit your lot. It is easier to select a home to fit your lot rather than adjusting your lot to fit the home plan. With the huge selection of plans available, it is likely you will find a plan that will fit your lot and meet your lifestyle needs.

It is important to be flexible when searching for your dream home. You shouldn’t immediately discard a plan because it does not meet all of your criteria. For example, if you want a home with a brick exterior, you might instinctively avoid all plans with a stucco or siding finish. However, adjusting the exterior is typically a minor change that most builders can accomplish. Plans can be adjusted to meet your needs and it is rare that a plan is built exactly as it is drawn. Some common changes are:

 - Adjusting window and door locations.
 - Minor room alterations.
 - Changing a plan's foundation to basement, crawlspace or slab.
 - Adding an extra bay to a garage.
 - Changing the garage to enter via the side of the house.

Some important factors to consider when determining your house plan are:

 - House width and depth: Will the house fit on the lot you already own or are interested in buying.  Don't forget about local requirements which dictate how much free space must surround your house or how far your home has to be set back from the street.
 - Square footage: Will the home provide enough space for your family's current and future needs?
 - Your budget: The national average for new home construction in the US is about $85 per square foot.  This number can vary from $60 up to $140 per square foot depending on your location, your builder, the style of home you wish to build, and the finish quality of your home.

Stayed tuned for the next part of this article where we will discuss the issues to consider when selecting a builder for your dream home.
