hi guys, 

READ THIS!sorry for shouting but this is so important. This
card really saves lives..go to www.mymedi-card.com. Check this
out. Suzy your folks for sure should have one, and for our little
pal Chad with his peanut allergy it is critical.

 The card list your m.d, your emergency contact, drugs you
take, allergies, and any medical conditions. That and all your
insurance info. When bob went to the hospital they all thought
it was fantastic.

When we go for a run, we take it ..ok enough, just take a
sec and check it out.

Love to all,

Mary and Gary
