Subject: Have You Found it is Trickier?
Content-Length: 9086
Lines: 267

Question: As someone who owns or manages a business website,
have you noticed lately that scoring high on the search
engines has gotten trickier?

Well, that's what we thought too -- until, we discovered
some side doors that the professionals have been using to
fast-track their sites to the top of the engines.

Mind you, everything they are doing is perfectly legitimate.
The trick is, they know exactly what strings to pull and
where to submit to get their sites preferential treatment
..and, so can you.

Allow me to explain: ...first of all, forget everything you
think you know about scoring high on the engines. Why?
..because most all of the strategies have changed,
recently, in just the past few months.

The GOOD NEWS is ...it's actually gotten easier to get top
placement PROVIDED THAT, you know the in's and out's.

For instance...

         ...right now there are many engines and directories
         that are sharing databases. Part of winning the war
         is knowing which directories and engines are the
         most influential. This information will show you how
         these engines are using your site information to
         determine your link popularity and page relevancy.

         Why is that important? ...because these factors are
         the keys that determine where your pages rank on
         several of the most important major search engines.

         Once you know, you'll have the information you need
         to determine which engines and directories are worth
         submitting to -- and which ones are a waste of time.

         Prepare to be surprised, however. Things are often
         not as they appear to be on the surface!

Did you know...

         ...a few major engines and directories are
         soliciting fees in exchange for preferential
         treatment?

         Is it worth it? ...YES -- but for heaven's sake, be
         careful. If you submit before your site is properly
         optimized you'll waste your money and get nothing
         for your efforts.

         Even worse is the fact that if you get the
         submission wrong, you may NOT get a second chance.

Are you aware that...

         ...several engines work from a single submission
         index but submitting to that index will get your
         page penalized?

         Yes, you read that right ...submitting your page to
         this VERY popular (and critically important) index
         will get your page penalized.

         The solution lies in submitting through one of their
         side doors and when you do so, your page
         automatically receives ongoing 'preferred VIP'
         treatment.

If ever there was a time when "information is KING", now is
that time because the most recent study proved that 55% of
all online sales come from people who click a link found on
a search engine.

When your page is found near the top of the heap, your
chances of online success are fantastic. But, if your site
is buried at the bottom of the listings, your chances of
success are practically zero. That makes getting on top of
the engines your most important online priority.

Is that fair? ...perhaps not. But, it is the way it is. Call
it an "online reality check".

The Solution:

For almost 5 years now there has been one source of
information that has continuously stood out as the Bible of
Search Engine Information. It's the same source that's been
giving search engine professionals an almost 'unfair
advantage' in winning the search engine wars.

We've recently made arrangements to provide you with this
'holy grail' of search engine information via online
delivery. You'll get the complete 170 page 'UnFair Advantage
Book on Winning The Search Engine Wars' that will teach you
every known trick and strategy that will place your site
right where it deserves to be -- at the top of the engines!

And, if you respond directly to this offer by Thursday, May 
24th, you'll receive the following bonuses...

         * Bonus #1 - Six months of in-depth updates that
         will tell you exactly what the latest changes are
         and how you should adjust your webpages to take
         advantage of them.

         * Bonus #2. A free six month subscription to Search
         Engine News -- the most respected search engine
         publication on the Internet. This is a paid site
         that charges $97 for a six month subscription but
         you'll get for free by ordering this week.

         * Bonus #3. You'll also gain access to the past
         four years of Search Engine News archives. Here you
         will find hundreds of valuable resources, marketing
         tips, and search engine related pointers that will
         literally give you an "UnFair Advantage" over your
         competition.

         * Bonus #4: Since the search engines are constantly
         changing, you'll need to stay abreast. Respond to
         this offer before the end of this week you'll also
         get future versions of "The UnFair Advantage Book"
         -- revised on the first of every month -- for each
         of the next SIX months.

Like I said before, this offer represents the 'holy grail'
of search engine information and is the very same source ALL
of the professionals are using right now to gain an unfair
advantage over the competition.

But, hey, don't take my word for it... I invite you to take
advantage of the situation and see for yourself. Order the
book today, download it, take the information for a spin and
if you don't agree the information is worth literally
thousands of extra dollars in your pocket due to the
advantage you'll gain over your competition, then ask for a
refund anytime in the next six months and keep the book
anyway!

..and, that's about the best guarantee in the business.

Don't hesitate.  Time is running out.  Place your RISK-FREE
ORDER NOW!
