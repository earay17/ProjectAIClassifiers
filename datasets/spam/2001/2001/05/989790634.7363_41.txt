U.S. State Department Sets Certification Testing for Finx Group's
Secure Portal System.
 
The FINX Group Inc. (OTC BB: FXGP) announced that its Secure
Portal System for high security applications, recently passed
the U.S. State Department's preliminary forced entry and
ballistics tests.

Lewis S. Schiller, chairman and chief executive officer, said
successful completion of the agency's stringent forced entry
and ballistics tests, as previously reported, paved the way for
final certification testing. The certification, when awarded, will
make possible State Department procurement for use in embassies,
consulates and other facilities around the world.
 
"We understand," Schiller added, "that with certification by the
State Department, other government markets may also be open to us."
 
The system is marketed by the FINX Group's subsidiary, Secure
Portal Systems Inc., under a license agreement with Georal
International Ltd., a world leader in such secure entry systems.
 
A person seeking entry to a facility through the circular, double-door
portal must first be positively identified through the use of advanced
electronic fingerprinting technology developed by another FINX
subsidiary, FMX Corp.
 
Once identity is verified, the nearest semi-circular door rotates
open, admitting the person to a chamber where sensors assure that
he or she is alone and carries no gun, knife or similar contraband,
all in a few seconds.


FINX GROUP INC (FXGP)- Broad Patent Covering Major Advance
in Electronic Fingerprinting - Awarded to Finx Group Subsidiary.
 
The FINX Group Inc., announced that its subsidiary, FMX Corp.,
has been awarded a broad patent covering significant advances
in electronic fingerprinting technology achieved by Michael
Schiller, its founder and president.
