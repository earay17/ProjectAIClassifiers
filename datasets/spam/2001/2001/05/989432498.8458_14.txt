"Service with your ISP program has been fantastic! I know
from experience that the kind of "above and beyond the call
of duty" service I have received since joining your program 
is not available ANYWHERE else! Looking forward to the new 
year as my business continues to grow!

I think it would be impossible for anyone not to succeed in
this! It is way too easy!"

"Tim,<br>
Thanks for the opportunity to participate in your ISP 
program.  It would have taken us ages to do what you have 
put together.  We are looking forward to using all of your
hard work and knowledge and applying it to our business.  
We think the combination of your model and little work from
us will make us very successful.
<br><br>
Thanks again for giving us the tools we needed."

<br><br>
"Tim- <br><br>

Thank you for the "thought power" that went into the design
of your private label Internet Service Provider system. The 
system is working as you designed it. It has been just 30 
days and we have already signed up a dozen people as 
affiliates to host our banner and have finalized 6 web 
site sales. The residual money is what sets apart this 
business from many others. The most important information 
that I can give anyone is that this is a "true business 
opportunity that works. Cash flow is king..."
<br><br>
Thank you again for the exciting addition to my existing company."

"Hi Tim,<br>
I just had to thank you for creating such a wonderful 
opportunity in the Be Your Own ISP business.Anyone that
takes advantage of what you have to offer will more than 
guarantee their future on the Internet! My own ISP 
business, who would ever have thought it? A product that 
everyone needs is now available from me, of all people! I 
am now looking forward to marketing my own business, my own
products, at my own prices! But, most of all, you have 
given me the chance to control my own destiny."

Keep up the excellent work!<br>

<center><h2> TESTIMONIAL:

"Even if I never sold...I will still save over $1,200 per year"</center></h2></p><p>

<br><br>
"I have been paying over a $100 per month in hosting fees for the last
two years. Through Tim I became my own
ISP a couple of months ago.  As soon as I transferred 4 of my
hosting accounts from Virtualis, I started saving over $100 per month.
So even if I never sold another virtual hosting account I will still save
over $1200 per year over the next 4 years.
<br><br>
Now, as far as, making money I am no longer restricted to the MSRP
(manufacturers suggested retail price).  If I want to make a deal with
you I can.  I can sell a site for  $25 or $50, I am in complete charge
of my business. With plenty of support."

<br>
I've been involved in a few business opportunities in the past.  But by far
this is the best!!  I have made real money with little effort in this
business.  The technical support is fantastic!!  They help you with every
step if needed. 
<br><br>

 I've even received help in promoting my business!  That's
what I like, the total support I've received.  It goes to show that you
don't have to be a computer geek to make money on the internet!

<a href="http://www.Find-Local-ISP.com">http://www.Find-Local-ISP.com</a></center></h2></p><p><br><br>
We are building another site similar to TheList.com.  However, on this website only
our active ISPs under contract are listed.  <br><br>Every active ISP has a protected population
area up to 50,000 people. (If you live in a town of 13,000 people isolated from other towns, then your
protected area would be 13,000 people).
<br><br>
Since we are adding ISPs at a rate of about 50 contracts per week, we will soon have
an ISP in every market. The bigger this list gets, the more popular it will become
on the internet as a place for customers to find their Internet Service Providers.
<br><br>
We market this website to well over 100,000 people on our email lists, and our 
search engine expert is registering it and monitoring the progress on all major
search engines.  This will help people in your local area to find you and 
become your customer.
<br><br>
Building a large organization also helps us to negotiate better deals
for our ISPs, such as our Omni offer below.
<br><br>
