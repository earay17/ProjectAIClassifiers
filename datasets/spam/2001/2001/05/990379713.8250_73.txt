SUBJECT: RECEIVE FREE INFORMATION ON SELF UNDERWRITING INVESTMENTS" 
Content-Length: 2042

Financial Information Corporation (FIC) is an information service that provides individuals with free information concerning self underwritings that have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but have not yet been closed. FIC receives a fee from listed companies and does not ever charge a fee to individuals requesting information. FIC is an information conduit and does not represent these companies, act as an agent, broker or dealer, recommend them or vouch for the accuracy of the information they send to potential investors. The purpose of this email is to ask if you would like to be added to our list of individuals interested in seeing information on our listed companies that might be of interest to you. 
A Self Underwriting is a stock offering where the company does not utilize the services of an underwriter in selling securities but rather sells its securities directly to investors. Very few people realize that over 50% of all offerings filed with the SEC are self underwritings. The potential advantages to investors is that they have an opportunity to buy these securities at the IPO price, there is never a commision or fee, the investor can usually invest small amounts of money and many of these offerings are priced low, many under $1 per share. 
If you are interested in seeing information on these types of companies, please click on the following link or paste the link on your browser http://www.fici.net/moreinfo.htm. By doing so, you are not obligated in any way to take any action or invest; you are simply supplied with information. Companies that have listed with us will be given your e-mail address only, to send you their relevant information. There is no risk; rather it provides you, a potential investor, with information concerning these companies. You may remove yourself from the list at any time. Thank you for your time and interest
