<p>Dear Windows User,<br>
<br>
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 95, 98 and ME to nearly
the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and industrial version
of Windows.<br>
<br>
The new WinFix is a very effective way to improve the reliability of Windows,
because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing.<br>
<br>
And WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of Windows.<br>
<br>
