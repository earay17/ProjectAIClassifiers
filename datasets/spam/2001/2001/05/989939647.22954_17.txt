Dear Casino enthusiast:

Are you looking for a clever casino gift? Something new,
innovative, practical, functional?...a gift that they'll
say " Hey, thats a great idea " ?

Say goodbye to coin buckets, bulky handbags, and those
boring fannypacks.

The Lucky Sak is the new, safer hands free way to carry
your casino essentials. The only waist pack/money belt 
that converts into a coin, chip, token pouch. Bingo &
travel stuff too! Slim unisex design and common sense
easier access are just two of the many benefits.

This is the same Lucky Sak sold at AAA auto club stores 
and casino gift shops nationwide.

How about this great value added gift idea- Stuff a 
Lucky Sak with quarters, slot gift certificate, dinner
reservations or show tickets from a favorite casino. 
Create any extra value you want with the theme " Have a
Lucky Day on me ".

For more info please send an email to: Mailto:winning_big@doglovers.com?Subject=info-Lucky Sak

visit our site and get our special web price plus a free 
gift.  You can also see our other really cool hands free
convertible bags you won't find anywhere else.
