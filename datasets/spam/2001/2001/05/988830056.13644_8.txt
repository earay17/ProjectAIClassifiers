It's amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simply=

I didn't like the way I looked and I didn't like the way I felt. I was at =

I have researched and tried many weight loss programs during my "yo-yo die=
ting" years. I did Slim Fast, Cybervision, Atkins, soup diets, starvation,=
 "exercise and eat no fat," chromium picolinate, metabolic enhancers, and =
more. You name it, I tried it!<BR>
I lost some pounds with every diet, but eventually gained them back, usual=
ly with a few extra pounds. On every one of those diets, I lost energy, an=
d eventually had to eat a lot to feel better. I was grouchy with a short f=
use. This even happened during the diet where I exercised and ate less wit=
h only low-fat foods, the better-known "right way" to lose weight. I'm sur=
e losing weight that way works OK for many people, but it just didn't work=
 very well for me. <BR>
It seemed my metabolism froze, and I was going to stay at that weight fore=
ver, but I wanted to look better and be healthy. I was very depressed and =
disappointed. I dieted on and off, but got nowhere. The weight kept return=
ing. <BR>
I suddenly realized just how difficult this weight problem had really beco=
me. Now I understood why so many people have the same problem.<BR>
<BR>
I almost gave up. Then, I remembered something I heard from old my friend =
Janie. She told me about a company who makes a nutritionally-engineered we=
ight loss product, which </FONT><FONT  COLOR=3D"#ff0000" SIZE=3D2 PTSIZE=3D=

 been kept a secret for years, UNTIL NOW. Scientists from an American Nutr=
iceutical company met up with their top scientist and brought the secret h=

<BR>
It sounded too good to be true. I didn't want to get all hyped up about so=
me new program, and I didn't want to add one more diet to my failure list.=
 <BR>
What really made me decide to try it were all the testimonials I read on t=
heir web site, written by so many Doctors, Celebrities, and people like yo=
u and me.<BR>
<BR>
I called for my 30-day supply and was so amazed when only after the first =
3 days, I began to experience a sense of "well being" - something I hadn't=
 felt for months, maybe years. I felt ENERGIZED, not to mention my sugar/c=
hocolate cravings were absolutely gone!<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE I FELT!</B></U><BR>
<BR>
I began to hope again - maybe I could lose this old weight. I gave this pu=

After 5 weeks of BerryTrim Plus I had already lost 10 inches off my hips a=

I really wish I could show you how I looked 10 months ago compared to how =
I look now. The differences are unbelievable. I recently traveled and when=
 I had to show a picture I.D. at the airport for security reasons, the air=
line agent asked for "another" form of picture I.D. because my driver's li=
cense picture doesn't look like me anymore! <BR>
<BR>
It's kind of embarrassing receiving all of the compliments about how "grea=
t I look" now. It's even more embarrassing to mention it. But they keep co=
ming. The greatest compliment I got was from my husband, Recently, he told=
 me, "Olivia, you really look great, you look like the young girl I kissed=
 at our wedding." I said, "WHAT?" He told me that I "looked younger". He s=
aid my face looked especially younger, "you look like the real you!" <BR>
It was true, just like everything I had read about the product. It all cam=
e true! <BR>
That was a first for any weight loss program I had ever tried.<BR>
The changes that took place were both subtle and obvious. Here are some of=
 them: <BR>
<B>MY ATTITUDE IMPROVED<BR>
I HAVE LESS TENSION AND ANXIETY<BR>
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY FAMILY IMPROVED<BR>
QUALITY OF MY SLEEP IMPROVED<BR>
I NOW SLEEP THROUGH THE ENTIRE NIGHT<BR>
I HAVE GREATER ENERGY<BR>
COMPULSIVE EATING DECREASED<BR>
CRAVINGS FOR SWEETS DECREASED<BR>
I HAVE LESS FREQUENT HOT FLASHES<BR>
NO LONGER DRINK CAFFEINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY<BR>
NO LONGER SLEEP FOR HOURS IN THE AFTERNOONS<BR>
NO LONGER EXPERIENCE DISCOMFORT WITH MOVEMENT.</B><BR>
I feel better now than I've felt in years. Thanks to BerryTrim Plus and Ja=
nie, who introduced me to it. <BR>
I invite you to try it for 30-days. I promise you'll be calling for more s=
oon after!"<BR>
Look, if you want to try out this product, it can change your life. If you=
 don't want to, that's OK too. At least find some way to lose weight that =
works for you. Your life will change after you lose the weight. Many peopl=
e won't try it because they won't believe it. Unfortunately, with all the =
marketing and scams out there, we all have to be skeptical. If I tried to =
hand out fifty dollar bills on a city sidewalk, most people would not take=
 it because they would think it was some kind of trick. This is not a tric=
k. It worked for me. <BR>
Whether you need to take off five pounds or five hundred, this will help y=
ou do it in a healthy way. The company has a 60-day money-back guarantee, =
and I called to check on that. They get practically no returns and 92% re-=
orders. That says it all if you ask me. You order directly from the compan=
y and use a credit card. Their link is at the end of this story. , Click t=
hrough this website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product h=
as done for so many people like you and me! <BR>
<BR>
I can assure you that I would not publicly put my credibility on the line =
unless everything I have told you here was 100% true. So, do take a look a=
t the many success stories from others who have gained better health, impr=
oved their relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it of=
f for good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this =
is something you are willing to try - GO FOR IT!!!!! You won't be sorry. D=
o take the time to read them. Many are more AMAZING than my own!<BR>
