Are you using potato?  KDE isn't officially in potato, its only in sid (so
you'd have to be running atleast woody to get it ;-)

Now you can add a line to your /etc/apt/sources.list to get your debian
packages directly from KDE.  If you're running potato then you want to add

deb
http://ftp.sourceforge.net/pub/mirrors/kde/stable/latest/distribution/deb/
stable main

Then you just need to run

apt-get update ; atp-get install task-kde

Now I've never run KDE on a potato machine, so I don't know if you'll have
to upgrade to X4 or not, amung other things.  You may want to add the "-u"
option to "atp-get install task-kde", that way it will show you every
package it will be touching, so you'll know whats going on.

I think thats about it.
