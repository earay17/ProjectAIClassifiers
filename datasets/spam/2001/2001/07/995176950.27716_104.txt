$  Teacher Seeks Student  $

I am a financially independent wealth-builder, who finds great 
pleasure in mentoring The Keys to Life and Financial Freedom. 

I teach one-on-one and will actually build a business with select inquisitive students. 

The three people I choose as partners will become very wealthy.

Are you one?


YES - Inquisitive student seeks more information
mailto:lister@theglobal.net?subject=YES

NO - And please remove me from any and all lists that contain my email address
mailto:lister@theglobal.net?subject=remove


"When the student is ready, the teacher will appear,"

Teacher
