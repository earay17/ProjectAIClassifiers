MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability=2E It is bei=
ng taught in the Harvard Business School,=20
and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that be=
tween 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-lev=
el methods by the mid to late 1990's=2E=20

This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000 millionaires =

You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump (A =

w=2E Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to star=

 network marketing company and get to work=2E The audience started to hoot=

 "That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!"=20

With network marketing you have two sources of income=2E Direct commission=
s from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people y=

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy=2E It means investing time or=
 money once and getting paid again and again and again=2E In network marke=
ting, it also means getting paid for the work of others=2E=20

This program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different countri=
es across the world=2E=20

The enclosed INF0RMATION is something I almost let slip through my fingers=
=2E Fortunately, sometime later I re-read=20
everything and gave some thought and study to it=2E=20

My name is Johnathon Rourke=2E Two years ago, the corporation I worked at =
for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated=2E Aft=
er unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business=2E Over =
the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems=2E I owed my =
family, friends and creditors over $35,000=2E The economy was taking a tol=
l on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet=2E I had to re=
finance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling bus=
iness=2E AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and=20
I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your l=
ife FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!=20

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail=2E Six month's prior t=
o receiving this program I had been sending away=20
for INF0RMATION on various business opportunities=2E All of the programs I=
 received, in my opinion, were not cost effective=2EThey were either too d=
ifficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for m=
e to risk to see if they would work or not=2E One claimed that I would mak=
e a million dollars in one year=2E=2E=2Eit didn't tell me I'd have to writ=
e a book to make it!=20

But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program=2E I di=
dn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name=20
off a mailing list=2E THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several =
times, to make sure I was reading it orrectly,=20
I couldn't believe my eyes=2E Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON=2E I coul=
d invest as much as I wanted to start,=20
without putting me further into debt=2E After I got a pencil and paper and=
 figured it out, I would at least get my money back=2E But like most of yo=
u I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspe=
cts of it all=2E So I checked it out with the US Post Office (1-800-725-21=
61 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining t=
he=20
program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "WHY NOT=2E"=20

Initially I sent out 100,000 e-mails=2E It cost me about $15 for my time o=
n-line=2E The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for =
printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are fulfill=
ed via e-mail, the only expense is my time=2E I am telling you like it is,=
 I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "r=
ip-off" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me=2E=20

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1=2E B=
y January 13, I had received 26 orders for=20
REPORT #1=2E Your goal is to "RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WIT=
HIN 2 WEEKS=2E IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!" My firs=
t step in making $46,000 in 90 days was done=2E=20

By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2=2E Your goal is to =

 I had 196 orders for REPORT=20

By March 1, of my e-mailing of 100,000, I received $42,000 with more comin=
g in every day=2E I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car=

oes work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not tryi=
ng to place your name in a different place=2E It won't work, you'll lose o=
ut on a lot=20
of money! In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20=
+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders for=20
REPORT #2 and you will make $46,000 or more in 90 days=2E I AM LIVING PROO=
F THAT IT WORKS!!!=20

If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry=2E It really =
is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you=2E If you choose to=

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:=20

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should hav=
e concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have bee=
n created by an amateur=2E Let me tell you a little about myself=2E I had =
a profitable business=20
for 10 years=2E Then in 1979 my business began falling off=2E I was doing =
the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't work=
ing=2E Finally, I figured it out=2E It wasn't me, it was the economy=2E In=
flation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with u=
s since 1945=2E I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment=
=20
rate=2E=2E=2E because many of you know from first hand experience=2E There=
 were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before=2E=20

The middle class was vanishing=2E Those who knew what they were doing inve=
sted wisely and moved up=2E Those who did not, including those who never h=
ad anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the poor=
=2E As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER=2E" T=
he traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "move up" o=
r "get rich", inflation will see to that=2E=20

You have just received INF0RMATION that can give you financial freedom for=
 the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and=20
"JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT=2E" You can make more money in the next few m=
onths than you have ever imagined=2E=20

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor any=
one else who has provided a testimonial for this=20
program=2E I have already made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS! I have retired from=
 the program after sending out over 1,600,000 programs=2E Now I have sever=
al offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas=2E=
=20

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED=2E Do not change it in any way=2E=
 It works exceedingly well as it is now=2E=20
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can thin=
k of=2E One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more=2E=
=2E=2Eand your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more=
 you send out the more potential customers you will reach=2E=20

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials and oppor=
tunity to become financially independent, IT=20
IS UP TO YOU NOW!=20

"THINK ABOUT IT"=20

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a =
little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT=2E Get a pencil and figur=
e out what could happen when YOU participate=2E Figure out the worst possi=
ble response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot=
 of money! You will definitely get back what you invested=2E Any doubts yo=
u have will vanish when your first orders come in=2E IT WORKS! Jody Jacobs=

There are two primary methods of building your downline:=20

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL=20

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'=
ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each=2E =
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0=2E3% response=2E Using a g=
ood list the response could be much better=2E Also, many people will send =
out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000=2E But continuing w=
ith this example, you send out only 2,000 programs=2E With a 0=2E3% respon=
se, that is only 6 orders for REPORT #1=2E Those 6 people respond by sendi=
ng out 2,000 programs each for a total of 12,000=2E Out of those 0=2E3%, 3=
6 people respond and order REPORT #2=2E Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs e=
ach for a total of 72,000=2E The 0=2E3% response to that is 216 orders for=
 REPORT #3=2E Those 216 send out 2,000 programs each for a 432,000 total=2E=
 The 0=2E3% response to that is 1,296 orders for REPORT #4=2E Those 1,296 =
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,592,000 total=2E The 0=2E3% response=20=

to that is 7,776 orders for REPORT #5=2E=20

That's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this example i=
s$30 + $180 + $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!!=20

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL T=
O WILL DO ABSOLUTELY=20
NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPP=
EN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS=20
INSTEAD OF 2,000=2E Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! B=
y the way, your cost to participate in this is=20
practically nothing=2E You obviously already have an internet connection a=
nd e-mail is FREE!!!=20

REPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing, tell yo=
u where to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lis=
ts and show you how to send out 1,000,000 e-mails for free=2E=20

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET=20

1=2E Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUND=
REDS of FREE places to advertise=2E Let's say you=20
decide to start small just to see how well it works=2E Assume your goal is=
 to get ONLY 6 people to participate on your first level=2E (Placing a lot=
 of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response=2E) Also as=
sume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline members=2E=
 Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below=2E=20

t 6 people each=2E Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 peo=
ple to participate! Many people will get 100's of participants! THINK ABOU=
T IT!=20
