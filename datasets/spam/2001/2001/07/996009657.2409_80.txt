The major averages closed out the week on a positive note. The markets are 
looking bullish and there are certain OTC companies which are coming into 
favor, especially in the Oil and Gas sector. We recently saw TIDE run from 
0.40 to 1.75 on heavy volume. That is a gain of over 300% in just two months 
with additional upside very possible! We would like to present another Oil 
and Gas company which we feel could have the same potential. 

At this time - We bring you: 

*** KING RESOURCES, INC. (OTC BB: KING) *** 

Shares issued and outstanding 67,439,804 less 32,500,000 shares pending 
retirement by CEO. 

http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010712/n1236800.html 

Float: Est'd @ 10.525,000 
52-week Range: $0.09 by $0.88 
Last Trade: $0.18

The industrialized world has realized there really is a limited supply of oil and 
gas. This is reflected in the current prices we now pay! These prices may well 
hold for the next several years justifying exploration drilling for the first time 
since the early 80s. 

KING MAY REPRESENT AN EXCELLENT BUYING OPPORTUNITY WITH POTENTIAL FOR 
SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL APPRECIATION IN 2001, BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 

1. KING recently Acquired a Seismic Exploration Database! 
In May, KING completed the acquisition of an exploration database with an 
appraised value of $65 million (see May 11, 2001 8-K Report). 

2. The Potential for World Class Oil Reserves in Gabon!
In February, King Resources announced that it had acquired 100% of Nescor 
Energy Salsich Gabon, Ltd., subject to the agreement with Nescor Energy 
Company, Ltd., which holds the 300,000 acre Salsich permit in Gabon. 

* According to the company, potential reserves at Salsich are over one 
billion barrels! 

* According to the company, two structures that have been drilled and tested 
have potential reserves of 80 million barrels! 

3. Huge Land Position in Australia Targeting Coalbed Methane Gas! 
On March 1st, KING announced that it had acquired an Authority to Prospect 
covering approximately 470,000 acres in Queensland (Australia). The venture 
is targeting coalbed methane gas deposits and will be operated by Queensland 
Gas Company Limited. 

4. KING resources chairman to retire company shares HUGE NEWS! 

Very Bullish! >>> Read more:

The Final Word: 

According to a recent 8-K filing, the seismic database has an appraised 
value of $65 million or about $1.62 per share. Can this price per share be 
realized? I wouldn't want to waste your time with anymore facts. Put KING 
on your radar screen now!
