CBYI Has been in bussiness since 1976. CBYI is a reporting company.
They are in the business of SMELL TECHNOLOGY analyzers which is already
an established market in current leak detection and monitoring
in most chemical companies and the pipeline industry. Every Airport
passenger, grocery store item, restaurant order, hospital 
patient and package coming into the country will be monitored
using SMELL TECHNOLOGY in the next decade. CBYI's clients/users
include Anheuser-Busch, Chevron Refining, Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, GE-Energy & Environmental Research, and the
U.S. Air Force just to name a few. The company has 
already filed for trading on the NASDAQ OTCBB Small Cap Market.
Right now the stock is trading around $1.20 a share.
We believe that the stock is undervalued/undiscovered and 
should thrust into the $4.00 -$5.00 range in the short term.
CBYI has many exclusive contracts which tells us that this
stock is poised for explosive growth. We recommend you own 
the stock today. We think there will be many Analysts recommending 
the stock as well as Newsletters getting involved in the upcoming weeks. 
Our last pick was two weeks ago (PINKSHEETS: PROW) 
Progress Watch Corporation. PROW is up over 200 % from the
price we recommended it. We beleive CBYI has more growth 
potential since the stock will be listed on the OTCBB within
the next 30-45 days. And are expected to beat earnings estimates.
Their is less than 100,000 shares in the float with all the stock
locked up held by the insiders.
