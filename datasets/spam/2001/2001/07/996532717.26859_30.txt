  <li>
    <p align="left">These people do not reach middle age until their late 80's
    and old age well past 110</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Their hair never turns gray - they never go bald - they keep
    a full set of teeth...even into their 100's and never need hearing aids or
    glasses in their entire lives.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The women do not reach menopause until their early
    70's...while the men retain full virility and the same sexual capability at
    age 85 or even 95 as they enjoyed in their 20's and 30's</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">None of these people - not at any age - ever suffer from
    arthritis, bursitis or rheumatism.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Serious and often fatal diseases such as diabetes, cancer,
    heart attacks, strokes and Parkinson's are virtually unknown...and for this
    select group of people, lesser afflictions such as colds, viruses,
    headaches, backaches, heartburn and insomnia, simply do not exist.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Perhaps most amazing of all - they never take vitamin pills,
    minerals or any supplements whatsoever.</li>

<p align="left">They are a select group of French men and women, who have been
carefully monitored by medical science for the past number of years.&nbsp; They
come from all walks of life...reside in central Polynesia...perform the same
daily activities as the average American family - and are no different than you
and I...except for one very significant, major difference.</p>
<p align="left">They have all been directed to eat a very special kind of food
at least once a day...a food virtually unknown in any other part of the
world...a food that medical doctors in this country firmly believe is:</p>
<p align="left"><b>The world's richest source of cellular rejuvenating enzymes-
that fortify the immune system, regenerate your body's cells and actually
reverse the aging process!</b></p>
<p align="left">The name of this anti-aging, life-extending food is <font size="5"><b><u><i>NONI</i></u></b></font>,
(from the French phrase, &quot;non-annee&quot; - never age), because for the
first time in medical history scientist report a completely natural food source
that can:&nbsp; The best source is when the noni has the seed extract
inside.&nbsp; Only Christian Brothers Health Corp has the noni seed extract
included.&nbsp; Please call 800-395-7379 to order noni juice today.&nbsp; Noni is

<p align="center"><font size="4">&nbsp; You will find that our price is the most
affordable and that our noni is the thickest (not watered down as others
are)&nbsp; Our Noni comes from Dominica.&nbsp; Dominica soil is
richest in soil minerals among the other Caribbean islands due to the volcanic
virgin soil the Noni fruit comes from.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We challenge you to find another place that has anywhere near as
strong and potent a juice as ours or as inexpensive.&nbsp; Noni Juice is
normally between $40 and $60 per bottle, has less then 90% Noni inside and does
not include the special extract from the seed as does ours.&nbsp; Our Noni juice is over 95%
Noni, includes the extract from the seed and is less expensive then any other
Noni on the web because network marketing is not involved. Don't lose this
e-mail!&nbsp; Pass it onto a friend who my need some health hints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stacking is the
best way to recover from disease.&nbsp; Stacking involves putting a few
different holistic therapies together to beat a specific ailment.&nbsp; Please
