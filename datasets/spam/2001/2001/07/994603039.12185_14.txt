<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>If you can't urinate, you will in a few
weeks.&nbsp; If you are urinating frequently during the night, that will
stop.&nbsp; Willow Flower strengthens the prostate, gets rid of the swelling and
detoxifies the whole area between the anal gland and the urinary track.&nbsp;
Get started and watch.&nbsp; (you do not have to stop taking Sal Palmetto, do
them both)&nbsp; We do not fully understand how this herb works but it has not
failed yet.&nbsp; It comes from Germany and has been in the U.S. for a short
time.&nbsp; If you have prostate cancer, it is strongly recommended that you
take Willow Flower Herb among other natural healers to obtain wellness.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>This is not a capsule or tablet.&nbsp; It is
pure wild grown herb that you make tea out of.&nbsp; Tea is the best method to
use in order to get maximum benefit from an herb.&nbsp; Warm liquid that
extracts the nutrients from the herb while simmering is far more potent then
ingesting a pill.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Willow Flower Herb has a history of working
well with women's urinary problems as well.</b></font></p>

<p>The Willow-herb, until now hardly found mentioned in herbals, has since the
first publication of this book in the German language started an almost
triumphal march across Europe and even further, as a medicinal herb for
disorders of the <b>prostate gland</b>.</p>
<p>Since there are several species of Willow-herb and some people are uncertain
which are the ones with the medicinal properties I will mention the ones that
can be used:</p>
<b>
<p>Pink Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium parviflorum), <b>Mountain Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium
montanum), <b>Dark-green Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium obscurum), <b>Lance-leaved
Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium lanzeolatum), <b>Hill Willow-herb</b> (Epilobium
collinum), <b>Marsh Willow-herb</b> (Eppilobium palustre, <b>Gravel Willow-herb</b>
(Epilobium anagallidifolium). The Willow-herbs with the colour is reddish, pale
pink to almost white. The flowers stand on thop of the long thin pod-like seed
vessels. These later split, disclosing many silky whites hairs in which are
embedded the tiny seeds.</p>
<p>A chemist in Munich showed me an old pharmacopoeia where it was still
mentioned around 1880. Drugs have pushed it aside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many who suffer from a disorder of the prostate gland are able to find relief
without an operation through the Willow-herb. If an operation has been performed,
the Willow-herb tea relieves the burning and other complaints which often occur
afterwards. But in any case a doctor can be consulted.</p>
<p>In many cases operations can be avoided when Willow Flower herb is
administered first.</p>
<p>Infusion: 1 heaping teaspoon per ¼ litre of boiling water, infused for a
short time. Only 2 cups a day are taken, 1 cup in the morning on an empty
stomach, 1 cup in the evening ½ hour before a meal.</p>
