<p>Dear Windows User,<br>
<br>
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 95, 98 and ME to nea=
rly
the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and industrial v=
ersion
of Windows.<br>
<br>
The new WinFix is a very effective way to improve the reliability of Windo=
ws,
because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing.<br>
<br>
And WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of Win=
dows.<br>
<br>
<u><font color=3D"#0000ff"><a href=3D"http://win987.checkchange100.com/">C=
LICK HERE</a></font></u> to find out more about WinFix, the safest, most e=
ffective way to keep you working, by keeping your PC working non-stop.<br>
