Dear Friend,

LOOKING FOR A SPECTACULAR OPPORTUNITY ? 


PLEASE READ THESE FEW PAGES AND SEE FOR YOURSELF, YOU WON'T BE SORRY 
SO GO FOR IT, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID! EARN $100,000 OR MORE 
PER YEAR SENDING E-MAIL!!! 

(A mind Blowing Opportunity) ( Please Read On Don't Delete This ) 

I felt compelled to share this with anyone interested in 
spending more time with their families, instead of at work. 
It's an interesting story - Read it all & see what I mean. 

================================================================ 
"Parents of 15-year old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet." 
================================================================ 

********* Does this headline look familiar? ********** 

Of course it does. You most likely have seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 

This 15 year old's mother was cleaning and putting laundry away 
when she came across a large brown paper bag that was 
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the 
back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have prepared 
her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it 
was full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and 
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 

"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 
41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that 
bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year". 

The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership 
where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came 
home right away and they drove together to the boy's school 
and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money 
came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the 
closet. 

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the 
Internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he 
got off of the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 
months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his 
bedroom. 

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I 
Sent five dollars to five people for the Reports, put my name on 
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says 
the clever 15-year-old. The Reports I received for my 25 dollars 
were fantastic. 

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions 
to send one $5 dollar bill to each of the 5 individuals. These 
individuals would in turn e-mail me the 5 Reports. Put your name 
and mailing info in the number one position, move the number 
two person to position #3. 
Move the third person to the 4th 
position, and move the fourth person to the fifth position. 
The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills 
within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name in the number one position. 
"I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think it was gonna work", the boy continues. 

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post 
Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game 
magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, 
but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. 

"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office 
and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed 
in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to 
the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or some- 
thing (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and 
they had a whole box of more mail for me. 

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the 
E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting 
it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my 
homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the 
area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I 
kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time 
in my backpack.
I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in 
[to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me. 

Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid. The 
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 
'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. 
In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,
Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code 
of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or 
service must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five dollar bill that he received, he immediately sent out 
the report requested. This Report made the letter legal because 
he was exchanging a service (Sending a Report requested) for a 
five dollar fee. 

The Reports that you will receive and eventually send out, are 
the power behind the program. They include insider tips and 
techniques for cost effective promotion. These Reports are 
very comprehensive and will allow you to build and promote 
any business product or service on the internet. 

You have just read the letter that the 15-year-old was sending 
out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, 
simply by following the instructions in this letter.

----------------------------------------------------------------- 
There are two primary methods of building your downline: 

METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 

let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response.
(the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2% . 
Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
With a 0.2%response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each 
for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. 
That = 100 people responded and 
ordered Report #2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails 
each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3. 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. 
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half million).

Your total income in this example is:

$50+ 
$500+ 
$5,000 + 
$50,000+ 
$500,000.........Grand Total = $555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. 
GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES! 
NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE FAR MORE MONEY THAN YOU INVEST! 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone,
or even one 3rd of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? 
There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. 
Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!

METHOD #2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. 
Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. 
We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along.

For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. 
That's it. 
Always provide same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, 
will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you where to obtain free 
bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists. 

THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is 
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE 
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the 
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be 
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. 
I am sure that you could earn up to $500,000 or more in the next 90 days. 

Before you say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully. 

This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. 
Basically, this is what you do: 
As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners 
and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level 
business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. 

YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are 
not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. 

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do: 

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list above: 
(you can't sell them if you don't order them). 

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, 
YOUR E-MAIL AND ADDRESS, YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) 
and to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report. 

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE 
IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! 

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. 
You will need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. 

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. 
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's 
of people who will order them from you. 

2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, 
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "f" 
or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. 
Once you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. 

a. Look below for the listing of available reports. 

b. After you've ordered the five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. 

This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt laughing all the way to the bank! 

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. 

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.  

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. 

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. 

f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. 

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! 

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. 
Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. 

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). 
You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE! 

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase 
will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails,

************************************************************ 

My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. 
I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail." 
I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. 
I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. 
I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... 
well, the laugh was on me! 
Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. 
Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! 
I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. 
I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby." 
I did have seven more years until retirement, 
but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. 
We owe it all to MLM.

************************************************************ 

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, 
lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. 
I was approached several times before I checked this out. 
I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. 
To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. 

Charles Morris, Esq. 

************************************************************ 

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. 
But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little 
that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. 
Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders! 
For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. 
I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. 
The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. 
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. 

Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA 

************************************************************ 

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. 
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was 
e-mailed another program, ....11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!
I made more than $41,000 on the first try!! 

Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA 

*********************************************************** 

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, 
and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. 
The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. 
For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!
