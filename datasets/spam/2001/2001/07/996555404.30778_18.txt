means your present at the auction site. When the <BR>
item comes up for bid you can write down your bid <BR>
and bidder number. Place your bid into an envelope. <BR>

set by the auction. You then mail it to the auction by <BR>
the cut off date. All the bids will be opened at the <BR>
same time. The highest bidder wins. The losers deposit <BR>
is returned along with the results of the auction. <BR>
<BR>
6. What is a sealed bid? <BR>
<BR>

informational sheet that describes the property being <BR>
offered for sale and includes the terms and conditions <BR>
of sale. It contains all the information needed to bid <BR>
on an item. When interested in an item, just submit your <BR>
bid to the agency, usually by mail. On Bid-opening date, <BR>
bids are read publicly and awarded to the highest bidder <BR>
who correctly followed the required procedures. <BR>
<BR>
7. What are reserve auctions? <BR>
<BR>
Reserve auctions are generally open to the public. <BR>
The auctioneer offers items with a minimum price. If <BR>
price is not reached in the bidding, the item is not sold. <BR>
When an owner of the item is present, the auctioneer will <BR>
ask the owner of item if he/she excepts the lower bid <BR>
<BR>
8. What is Pre set? <BR>
<BR>
Auctioneers must except all bids. If only one bid is made <BR>
for say one dollar. The auctioneer must sell that bidder <BR>
the item for one dollar. <BR>
