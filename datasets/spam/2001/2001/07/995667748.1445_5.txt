Millions of North Americans lose assets to the government and lawyers every year for one 
reason:

THEY PUT ASSETS IN THEIR OWN NAME!

THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO LOSE ASSETS IS TO PERSONALLY OWN ASSETS.

The key is to control assets not own them.


How do you do this with out the fear of losing your assets?

Simple! It is a three step process:

1.	Purchase a self-directed Turks and Caicos Asset Protection Trust for $999

2.	Open an International Bank Account

3.	Buy something in the name of the Trust


Then, to get a real thrill have a lawyer do an asset search on your personal social security 
number and see if the new asset in the name of the trust shows up.

 It won't because you don't own it!!!
