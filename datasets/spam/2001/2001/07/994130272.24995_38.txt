3 INTERLOCKING SALES INTENSIFIERS!
by Larry Dotson

1) FLEXIBLE OFFERS

Keep your offers as flexible as possible. If you offer
a set price for your product, you could also offer the
people that can't afford it an optional payment plan.
For example, "3 Easy Payments Of $19.95".

A few other options would be to tell prospects that
you'll take barter offers and you're open to negotiating.
Even if you lose a little money the first time, you gain
a customer and make the profits on the back end.


2) PLENTY OF OPTIONS

Give your prospects as many ordering options as
possible. You'll be able to make sales to the biggest
part of your target audience. If they can only pay by
check, and you don't accept them, you lose a sale.

Accept credit cards, debit cards, checks, money
orders and other forms of e-payments. You should
take orders by e-mail, web site, fax, mail, etc.


3) AD BEFORE FREEBIE

Make sure your visitors see your ad before seeing
your freebie. When you use free stuff to lure people
to your web site include it below your ad copy or
on another web page.

Also, you want to make sure you persuade them to
give you their e-mail address for future offers. You
could publish a free e-zine, have them sign up to a
contest your offering, etc.


QUICK READ SUMMARY

1) Offer payment plans, accept bartering offers and
be open to negotiation.

2) Capture the largest part of your target audience by
accepting multiple ordering options.

3) Design your web site so prospects see your ad
copy before they can grab your freebie and run.

**** The Simple Definition ****

ShareWare - Shareware is a form of try-before-you-buy software 
that is often mistaken for FreeWare. The goal behind ShareWare is 
to provide you an opportunity to evaluate the software before 
eventually either making a purchase or deleting the software. Most
ShareWare has a 14-30 day trial period after which the software is
supposed to be registered or deleted. Although ShareWare generally
remains functional after the trial period, if you continue using
it you are obligated to pay for it. Without registrations, high 
quality try-before-you-buy software couldn't exist!
