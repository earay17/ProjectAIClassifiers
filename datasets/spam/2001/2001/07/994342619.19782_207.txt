 Greetings: Monday, July 4th, 2001 Thank you for requesting and/or allowin=
g us to send to you this information=2E
=20
Just three years ago, a certain company was merely a gleam in its founder'=
s eye=2E  Today it has the third largest network marketing (MLM)=20
network in the world - and is growing at over 200,000 new distributors per=
 month and rising=2E
 So what does this mean for you?
If everybody and their dog have joined, are you too late?  Have you missed=
 the boat?  Is it all over but the shouting or is the best yet to come?  L=
et's just think about it=2E
At its present rate of growth, this company will double its size by the
end of this year and will overtake industry leader Amway as the world's
largest MLM business sometime next year=2E  All from a standing start just=
 a
few years ago=2E
Or, to put it a different way, here is a business that is attracting the
cream of the world's networking entrepreneurs like no other other business=

in the world - not even Amway=2E  Isn't this maybe just a hint that there =
is
something going on that you need to know about? So here is what I suggest:=

#1=2E - Go to my website http://www=2Eoneop=2Ecom/bizcust/mycust/SFI=2Ehtm=
 and read all about this business (it's called Six Figure Income or SFI fo=
r short)

#2=2E - Then sign up=2E  It will cost you nothing, and there are no hidden=
 traps or strings - all of which is part of the attraction for careful
entrepreneurs=2E

#3=2E -  Finally,  sit back and wait for my email=2E  I will be in touch w=
ith
you within a day or so with whatever help or hints you may need - with the=
 support and assistance, indeed, that has made this company so popular wit=
h the world's entrepreneurs=2E

The URL again?   http://www=2Eoneop=2Ecom/bizcust/mycust/SFI=2Ehtm =20
Check it out now!

With best wishes,
Bob Gebhart

actly
why there is so much  fuss about it, drop me a line at kobikat@zwallet=2Ec=
