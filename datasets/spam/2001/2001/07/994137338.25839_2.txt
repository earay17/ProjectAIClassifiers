Please Note: 

New Master Card/Visa eCommerce Regulations: 

Get Real-Time, or face stiff fines. Noncompliance fines $1,000 to 
$25,000 per month. 

Visa has published their definition of an electronic commerce 
transaction to include "...a transaction conducted over the 
Internet or other network using a cardholder access device,such as 
a personal computer or terminal," according to a recent Visa memo. 

Being in compliance will include processing all transactions 
considered "electronic" by using an approved "real-time" gateway, 
rather than software such as PC Authorize, IC Verify, PC Charge 
or other modem based credit card processing solutions.
