If you enjoy using Post-It notes and cannot possibly live without them,
you must consider purchasing the DesktopSticker!<P>

are on your computer screen, they also have a useful alarm to attract your
attention at certain times.<P>

Tired of losing your notes? DesktopSticker's Log Browser allows you to find
stickers in no time.<P>

Tempted? Well, do not make your mind up yet! Take a guided tour at
