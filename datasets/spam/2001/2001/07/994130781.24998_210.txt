<br>
Hello! My name is Tami Evans and I would like to share my experience as an=
<br>
inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope.<br>
<br>
It=FFFFFF92s amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that yo=
u simply<br>
don=FFFFFF92t want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight problem fo=
r the<br>
better part of a decade.<br>
<br>
My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the<br>
refrigerator.<br>
<br>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked=
<br>
At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or energy=
<br>
to respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder =FFFFFF97 If =
that thin,<br>
sexy, woman, in that short black dress =FFFFFF97 was really me? (My husban=
d proposed<br>
to me in that dress 10 years ago) I didn=FFFFFF92t even feel like that hap=
py woman<br>
in the picture =FFFFFF96 I was exhausted and so depressed.<br>
<br>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I wa=
s<br>
too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I w=
as<br>
tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day.<br>
<br>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting<br>
"career. " Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, &amp; even<br=
>
Phen-Phen, and the list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few day=
s,<br>
then it was only a matter of time until I reached my breaking point and<br=
>
ended up eating vast quantities of the very foods I=FFFFFF92d been denying=
 myself.<br>
NOTHING worked for me until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try a<br=
>
product that was nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That produc=
t<br>
was called <b><i><u><font style=3D"background-color: #ffffff" color=3D"#00=
80ff" back=3D"#ffffff" ptsize=3D"10" family=3D"SANSSERIF" lang=3D"0">BERRY=
TRIM
PLUS</font></u></i></b>.<br>
<br>
After about five days on <b><i><u><font style=3D"background-color: #ffffff=
" color=3D"#0080ff" back=3D"#ffffff" ptsize=3D"10" family=3D"SANSSERIF" la=
ng=3D"0">BERRYTRIM
PLUS</font></u></i></b>, I began to experience a sense of<br>
"well being" with increased energy - I didn=FFFFFF92t feel tired, irritabl=
e or<br>
sluggish. More Importantly, I didn't feel Hungry - something I hadn't felt=
<br>
for months, maybe years.<br>
<br>
I've been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought I had<=
br>
tried<br>
everything when...<br>
<br>
The Scale Moved!! I mean, really Moved! .<br>
<br>
I lost 126 pounds in 6 months.<br>
Within 6 months I dropped down to 156 pounds.<br>
<br>
Today, I can do many activities that I couldn't when I weighed 282 pounds.=
<br>
The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was! My doctor has examined=
<br>
me, and my weight loss has blown his mind! People that I used to work with=
<br>
and even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas! I truly wish<br>
everyone who is overweight knew about this program ... I plan to tell<br>
everyone I can who has struggled with his or her weight, like I have. I ca=
n<br>
feel your pain, believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the BerryTrim Plus<br=
>
program! It has given me a new lease on life=FFFFFF85 After losing 126 pou=
nds so<br>
far, I feel very confident, happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I recently wore<=
br>
that same black cocktail dress I wore when my husband proposed - 10 years<=
br>
ago! (I guess that woman in the picture really was me! ) I thought I would=
<br>
never look and feel like that again!<br>
<br>
<b><i><u><font style=3D"background-color: #ffffff" color=3D"#0080ff" back=3D=
"#ffffff" ptsize=3D"10" family=3D"SANSSERIF" lang=3D"0">BERRYTRIM
PLUS</font></u></i></b> is a powerful gift from nature that has touched ev=
ery aspect<br>
of my life! And from the bottom of my heart, I will always thank my dear<b=
r>
friend Judy for telling me about this wonderful product and giving me back=
<br>
the joy of living.<br>
IF I COULD DO IT, YOU CAN DO IT TOO!<br>
I was sick of being fat. I didn=FFFFFF92t like the way I looked and I didn=
=FFFFFF92t like<br>
the way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my four children, and=
<br>
myself to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you need to lose a few<=
br>
pounds, more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, click through this<b=
r>
website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for =
so<br>
many people like you and me!. The proof is in the pudding (so to speak) so=
<br>
take a look at the many success stories from others who have gained better=
<br>
health, improved their relationships, and of course, lost weight and are<b=
r>
keeping it off for good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you=
<br>
decide this is something you are willing to try =FFFFFF97 GO FOR IT!!!!! Y=
ou won't<br>
