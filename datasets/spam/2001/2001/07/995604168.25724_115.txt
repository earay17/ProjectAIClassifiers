<P><FONT FACE = "Arial" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "2">Dear Friends & Future Millionaires:
<P>AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
<P>Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an
<P>investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time.
<P>THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
<P>BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
<P>Before you say, "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter you
<P>have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this
<P>letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an
<P>entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see
<P>if
<P>it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not
<P>the program was legal.
<P>Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO Laws
<P>prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the
<P>simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25
<P>out of pocket cost". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
<P>THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
<P>This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was
<P>approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
<P>finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
<P>effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total
<P>$610,470.00
<P>in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."
<P>Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
<P>Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time
<P>but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
<P>mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions
<P>and walaa .. 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I
<P>only
<P>made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of
<P>$290,000.00.
<P>So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over
<P>$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in the program
<P>is
<P>to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything." More testimonials
<P>later but first,
<P>=====PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFEFENCE=====
<P>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
<P>If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and
<P>comfortably, please read the following. THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
<P>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
<P>FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
<P>TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:
<P>=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
<P>For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
<P>ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
<P>LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
<P>TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
<P>=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the reports.
<P>You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and
<P>resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.
<P>Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
<P>these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
<P>accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them
<P>from
<P>you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
<P>something happens to your computer.
<P>IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to
<P>each
<P>report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
<P>instructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose out on majority
<P>of
<P>your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see
<P>how
<P>it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested,
<P>and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their
<P>friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.
<P>But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy
<P>and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than
<P>what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
<P>Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
<P>1 . After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
<P>REMOVE
<P>the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it
<P>through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
<P>2 . Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
<P>3 . Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
<P>4 . Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
<P>5 . Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2.
<P>6 . Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE
<P>SURE
<P>you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
<P>**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it
<P>on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY TOHER CHANGES.
<P>Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist
<P>you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you
<P>purchase
<P>will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how
<P>to
<P>send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads
<P>and much more.
<P>There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
<P>METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
<P>Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we
<P>will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's
<P>also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
<P>could be much better but lest just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
<P>will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
<P>Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%
<P>response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
<P>by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
<P>50,000
<P>e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's = 100 people responded and
<P>ordered Report # 2.
<P>Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
<P>e-mails.
<P>The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
<P>Those 1000 people send out 5,000 each for a total of 5 million e-mails
<P>sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000
<P>orders for Report # 4.
<P>Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 50,000,000
<P>(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
<P>Report # 5
<P>THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half million).
<P>Your total income in this example is: 1 . $50 + 2 . $500 + 3 . $5,000 + 4
<P> $50,000 + 5 . $500,000 . Grand Total = $555,550.00
<P>NUBMERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
<P>RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF
<P>MONEY!
<P>REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
<P>MAILED TO.
<P>Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even
<P>one
<P>4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over
<P>150
<P>million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many
<P>people will do just that, and more!
<P>METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
<P>Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
<P>FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
<P>easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with METHOD #1
<P>and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
<P>do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same
<P>day service on all orders.
<P>This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and
<P>address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
<P>receive the report.
<P>========= AVAILABLE REPORTS ========================
<P>ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes:
<P>Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.
<P>Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of
<P>paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the

<P>address.

<P>continue sending e-mails until you do.
<P>=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should
<P>receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue
<P>advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
<P>=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN
<P>RELAX,
<P>because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue
<P>to
<P>roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down

<P>You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching whish report people are
<P>ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH
<P>OF
<P>E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
<P>There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!!
<P>FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGNATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just
<P>received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of
<P>your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more
<P>money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow
<P>the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCHTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works
<P>exceedingly well as it is now.
<P>Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
<P>name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 . #5 as instructed
<P>above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more
<P>e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the
<P>more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.
<P>So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
<P>opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!
<P>=============== MORE TESTIMONIALS ==================
<P>"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
<P>accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
<P>When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk
<P>mail". I
<P>made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and
<P>percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my
<P>supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I
<P>made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on
<P>her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks
<P>she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received
<P>total $147,200.00 . all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her
<P>"hobby".
<P>Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
<P>"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
<P>to
<P>participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the
<P>initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
<P>wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back".
<P>"I was surprised when I
<P>found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders. I made
<P>$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that
<P>it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better
<P>investment
<P>with a faster return and so big."
<P>Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
<P>"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if
<P>I
<P>should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
<P>another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.
