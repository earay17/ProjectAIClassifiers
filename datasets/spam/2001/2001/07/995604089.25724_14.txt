Hi,

If you own an Inkjet printer, Laser printer, or Copy machine you owe it to your self to take 5 minutes of your time to read what I have to say.

Most inkjet replacement cartridges cost around $25 each or more.  With our top quality new inkjet replacement cartridges a $25 cartridge would only cost $12.50.  If you want to save even more money on inkjet refills use our inkjet refill kits.  Many printers can get over $300 worth of refills for only  $35.    

The average Laser printer or copy machine toner cartridge cost around $150.  Some of the less expensive ones go for around $65, all the way up to over $300 each.  By using our toner refilling service a $150 toner refill would only cost you $75.  So, depending on your printing needs.  If you averaged one refill a month we could save you around $900 a year by simply using our toner refill service.

Bottom Line:  

We offer 3 ways for you to save money on your printing needs.

1. We offer premium quality inkjet refill kits tailored to your specific printer cartridges to ensure premium print quality.  Our refill kits include the proper ink for your printer, detailed instructions, devices you may need to properly refill your cartridges, and full email and telephone technical support.


2. We offer new replacement cartridges for most major brands of inkjet printers at up to 50% less than you would pay in the store if you do not wish to do the refilling yourself.  Our replacement cartridges are top quality and print great.

3. We offer laser printer and copier toner service that can save you over 50% on your toner needs.  It works like this.  You send us your empty toner cartridge(s).  We refill it with premium toner and send it back to you ready to use at half what you would pay at the store.

All of our ink and toner is premium quality and manufactured in the USA.  We guarantee our products will print to your liking or your money back.
