Hello,

I am contacting you about untroubled.org, with regards to a
few development ideas I had for building the website. Currently,
there are several professional firms online and small businesses like
yours that require development work, but they can not afford the cost
of running a database driven website. My team of developers have
completed a modular website system that has significantly lowered the
cost of websites that utilize databases. I'm quite anxious to
demonstrate the development services and art work that I believe
untroubled.org could utilize.  I would appreciate talking to 
you or your webmaster in more detail with regards to your goals with
untroubled.org and your knowledge level of the Internet.

It is reasonable to say that, for most businesses, a $15,000 website
"development project" will now cost $499 to activate and $49 per
month for module updates and hosting. By choosing to use a
predeveloped database and not to build a custom database, you will
save thousands of dollars.

Here is a list of ideas that I thought you would want as part of your
site:

* An infinite number of website pages generated by our software

* An ability to easily edit the content and layout of your website in
the administrative suite

* A shopping cart to sell your products or services with no
limitations on the number of products you can submit

* A Marketplace section which can accept company information or
offers by website visitors, such as a classified ad (Monitored by
yourself.)

* Have marketing tools that inform and educate your clients- features
like News Pages and Newsletters, etc.

* Allow your clients and audience to discuss topics on your website
in a Discussion Forum

* Have a Links Page to list useful resources for your site visitors

* Have a picture gallery that you or your clients can submit pictures to

* An "Advertising Section", where clients can post banner
advertisements

All of the tools are customizable and self-managed with an easy to
use administrative area. Our websites are ideal for a company to
lower their ongoing website management costs.

Please review these packages, starting at $499 and $49 a month and
going up to $2499 and $99 a month. I would really like to be able to
work with you because I know how much you will benefit from our
website tools and design. The cost advantage of our website is that
you receive software worth thousands of dollars for a fraction of the
cost on a monthly basis.  If you paid $15,000 for a site, it may be
obsolete in 3 years; if you paid $499 and
$49 a month, you will save thousands!

Here are quick descriptions of our module packages.

1)	Package One: US $499 set-up fee, and US $49 monthly hosting
and module usage fee.
