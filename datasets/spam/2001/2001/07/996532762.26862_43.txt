All you will need to run this disk is a Windows based computer and an Internet browser (no need to be connected to the Internet). Sorry no Macintosh version available (needed?) at this time.

These are tips and tricks that computer technicians know and now you have all the information available for a low price of only $15.95 postage paid!

This investment of only $15.95 truly outweighs the frustration of a poorly working good computer.
