IMAGINE........

you had bought Yahoo, AOL or Microsoft when they first 
started to trade on the stock markets.  How big would your 
portfolio be today?

We feel the companies we profile have the same potential. 

IMAGINE........

If you have a team of top analysts to do extensive research
on various companies for you...  

How large would your portfolio be today?

We believe the companies we have chosen to profile are the
hottest, new, up and coming small caps companies around.

Why?

Because our team of top analysts have done extensive
research on the various companies that we plan to profile,
from viewing there business model to interviewing the
management and analyzing the structure of the company. 
After a very thorough, due diligent process;  We then
decide if the company qualifies to be profiled by
Stocktalker. 

Unlike other stock pic sites that promise you huge,
unrealistic returns on your investment in a short period 
of time, we provide you with realistic target prices 
within more accurate time frames.

We are not paid cash or shares from the companies we
profile.  The choices we make come from over 25 years
experience in the public markets.

We plan to profile one company each month.  If you would
