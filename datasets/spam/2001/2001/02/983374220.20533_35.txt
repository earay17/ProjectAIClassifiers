If you are Canadian, your Internet address should reflect this. If you have already 
have a .com name, you should consider adding a .CA name.  In the past, .CA names 
were not readily available to the public as there were many restrictions as to who 
can register.  However, recent regulatory changes have since made .CA registrations 
easily available...

As of November 1, 2000, CIRA, the authoritative body for Canada's domain name 
registry, has reformed the .CA registration requirements.  Registrations for 
.CA domain names are now open for any business or individual residing in Canada.  
Since there can only be one registrant per unique .CA name, thousands of Canadians 
businesses and individuals are rushing to reserve their .CA name before it's taken.  
Registration is on a first come, first served basis and costs only CAN$29.95 per name.  
For more information on how to secure your .CA name, go to http://www.SecureThisDomain.com.
