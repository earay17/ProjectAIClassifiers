IMAGINE........

you had bought Yahoo, AOL or Microsoft when they first 
started to trade on the stock markets.  How big would your portfolio 
be today?

We feel the companies we profile have the same potential. 

IMAGINE..........

If you have a team of top analysts to do extensive research on various 
companies for you...  

How large would your portfolio be today?

We believe the companies we have chosen to profile are the hottest, 
new, up and coming small caps companies around.

Why?

Because our team of top analysts have done extensive research 
on the various companies that we plan to profile, from viewing 
there business model to interviewing the management and 
analyzing the structure of the company.  After a very thorough, 
due diligent process;  We then decide if the company qualifies 
to be profiled by Stocktalker. 

Unlike other stock pic sites that promise you huge, unrealistic 
returns on your investment in a short period of time, we provide
you with realistic target prices within more accurate time frames.

We are not paid cash or shares from the companies we profile.
The choices we make come from over 25 years experience in the 
public markets.

We plan to profile one company each month.  If you would like
