Special Alert for CEO's Human Resource and Benefit Managers: Start Planning NOW!


As of January 21, the Federal Government is requiring
that you rewrite each of your benefit plan booklets to
comply with new ERISA Summary Plan Description (SPD) regulations.

For most, this will be a complicated and time consuming task.
Your benefit plans will have to be reviewed. Your plan
documents will have to be revised. New SPD's must be prepared and
distributed to your employees and beneficiaries within the next two plan years.

Allow our professionals to relieve you of this burden.

Since 1977, we have reviewed new regulations and
published our analysis of what you must disclose
in both pension and welfare summary plan descriptions
based on the latest regulations. We will review your current
SPD's and tell you what needs to be fixed.  Then we can rewite
your booklets to comply with the new regulations will
accurately reflect your benefit plans and meet all federal
requirements. We guarantee our work will be to your satisfaction.

For more information, click reply and give your Name, Address, 
Phone Number, Email address, and the number of employess you currently have.
You will be contacted shortly.
