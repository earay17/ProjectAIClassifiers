Affordable Telecommunications Technology Corp.
OTCBB: ATTP
BUY AT $ 0.13
SELL TARGET $1.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !

SPECIAL ALERT (OTCBB: ATTP) MARKETING AGREEMENTS WITH
SPRINT, NEXTEL, MOTOROLA, PRIME CO, VOICE STREAM, GLOBAL
STAR, AND WEB LINK CONTRIBUTED TO EXPLODING REVENUES
FOR YEAR 2000 UP OVER 500% !!!

Affordable Telecommunications Technology Corp. (OTCBB: ATTP) is
capitalizing on the explosive two-way messaging products and
services sector and has enjoyed phenomenal sales growth with
pre-paid and post-paid wireless telecommunications products and
services. ATTP has grown from operating 3 retail stores to 11
throughout Texas and Louisiana currently servicing roughly 50,000 
customers with a potential customer base of over 11 million people
within the company's service area. 

ATTP's marketing agreement with Sprint Broadband Direct (NYSE: PCS)
signed in December should contribute dramatic revenue growth by offering
wireless Internet connections at SPEEDS UP TO 50 TIMES FASTER than
traditional dial-up modems. 

ATTP IS IN THE HOT SECTOR OF STOCKS SCORING HUGE GAINS THAT
ARE INVOLVED IN AUTOMATIC (WIRELESS) METER READING! Examples
in this area are (AMEX: EAG) from $1.12 to $3.60 and (OTCBB: CNES),
our last recommendation, from $ .09 to $.74.

ATTP operates a two-way data network covering the greater Houston
Metropolitan area and is evolving that network's technology to provide
Automatic (Wireless) Meter Reading services. ATTP's network technology
has developed "SMART" METERS which can read household electric
and water meters automatically and remotely. The Company's data
network reads utility meters by sending a signal that is received by a
smart device to send data hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. This
eliminates the need for an on-site reading of the information contained
in the meter. ATTP's cutting-edge process naturally saves time, money,
and is the most efficient way of providing accurate information from the
"smart meter".

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATION WITH SEVERAL TEXAS
UTILITIES TO INCORPORATE ATTP's TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR METER
READING SYSTEM!!!

WE ARE PROJECTING ATTP TO MOVE QUICKLY AS IT MAY VERY WELL
BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!

OTCBB: ATTP
Recent Price: $ .13
52 Week High/Low: $2.88 - $ .04
Shares Outstanding: 23.6 Million
Float: 12.5 Million
Target Price: $1.25

A comprehensive analysis of ATTP'S products, services, marketing
agreements, and ground-breaking technology clearly reveals that the
tremendous value of ATTP shares have been overlooked by investors.
The strength and performance of the company is backed by soaring
revenues. ATTP is a hidden gem that has seen its stock price unjustly
fall to all-time historical lows while the company enjoys exponential
growth. As our "TOP UNDERVALUED PICK", ATTP could be our biggest
winner this year!
