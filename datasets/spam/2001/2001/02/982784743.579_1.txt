NEW Revenue Opportunities though UCE and Global Biz Services
Put your own Co-Branded Auction/Exchange web site in Place!

Global Biz Services is now the owner of the famed UCE website
(www.ucebidmaster.com), responsible for bringing together volume
buyers and sellers of new and used computer equipment.  What you
may not know is Global Biz Services now offers this 'state of the
art' technology to YOU, our valued resellers.

You too can now have your own co-branded company auction site, with
a customized look and feel, up and running within days.

To find out more about YOUR OWN AUCTION SITE please call: 800-501-0577
or email us at resellers@gbsnow.com. Don't miss out!
Recent business alliances now allow us to offer you additional services
including warehousing, testing and fulfillment capabilities.

UCE.com is an Internet marketplace specializing in volume sale transactions
of computer equipment. Auction sites created in this net market environment
leverage the market pull of the UCE website to increase exposure to the
seller's listings, promoting more on-line sales transactions.  Sites achieve
this by "co-listing" on UCE. This co-listing strategy enables a listing to be
seen on the sellers hosted auction site AND the UCE auction site simultaneously
- without compromising the hosted site's private market. Bids generated from the
site's private buyer market are combined with bids originating from UCE site.
The result is increased bid activity.

We look forward to working with you and appreciate your involvement in the UCE
Net Marketplace.

Mention reference code RS021522 to receive your free company listing in our business directory.

FOR REGISTERED MEMBERS ONLY:
We are pleased to offer these new listings for your consideration.
