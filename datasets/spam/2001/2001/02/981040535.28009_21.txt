I am sending this note to you about a wonderful opportunity to reinvent your future with a company called Big Planet.  Big Planet offers anyone the opportunity to change his or her economic status by using the most powerful media form today……..the Internet!

The four most common reasons why people start this business:

1) They are unhappy in their business or employment situation.  This could mean they don't feel challenged or are simply bored.  They feel they have little chance to use their creativity or skills.  They don't feel in control of their schedule, therefore vacation and family stress is present.  They may not have respect for an employer, colleague, or partner.
2) They are not making THEIR income goals, whatever THEIR income goals may be, and should they ever stop working, they don't have a financial plan.
3) They are making their financial goals but don't have the time to enjoy it - they feel like they're on a treadmill; the job (business) is controlling them rather than them controlling the job (business).  They're not enjoying the fruits of their success.
4) Looking forward to retirement but will not be able to retire at the comfort level they had hoped, or will have to work longer than expected to obtain it.

Do any of these sound familiar to you?

	With Big Planet, you'll never be downsized, laid off, or forced to retire.  As an independent contractor, you are your own boss.  You work as much or as little as you please, without having to answer or explain to anyone.  It's the perfect home-based business: it can provide all the pleasures of working at home while sparing you the risks and difficulties of being on your own.

	You can choose to put in a few part-time hours to supplement your income, or you can dedicate yourself to joining the ranks of the country's mega-distributors, some of whom are among America's biggest income earners.  Whether you choose one of those paths or something in-between that's uniquely suited to your situation, the choice is entirely yours.  Whatever you decide, you will maintain your freedom.

	As with any opportunity, you should take your time and investigate Big Planet.  You may find additional information at my website  dwp.bigplanet.com/tjloucks           
Please take some time to look over the information, and please contact me if you would like more information.  This is NOT a get rich quick scheme.  It does require some effort and time on your part.  Whatever effort you put into the business, you will get back ten-fold monetarily.
