You will find some of the best employment sites on the web, I strongly suggest you register with USJobBoard ASAP, don't worry if you do not have a CV, you do not need one to register. 
Remember the sooner you register, the sooner your dream job can find you!

Don't worry if you are not a US Citizen, there is an excellent site on how to get a Green Card and open a US bank Account to get you started, or what about Canada ?

Happy Hunting
