  <b>What most Internet users don't realize is that from the moment you log on 
  until the moment you log off you are generating a good deal of cash, even if 
  you do not buy or fill out anything!<br>
  </b></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0066FF"><b>The Going Platinum Community is an opportunity 
  to own the Internet, or at least your own piece of it.</b></font> </p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a Full Service ISP </li>
  <li>Internet Gateway</li>
  <li>Search Engine/Directory </li>
  <li>Shopping Mall </li>
  <li>Virtual Office </li>
  <li>And just about anything else you can think of, all rolled into one easy-to-use 
    site. </li>
</ul>
<p>Besides your own email account, mail room, marketing center and Internet tools 
  that you never dreamed existed; you'll have access to anything and everything 
  that the Internet has to offer. From chat rooms, news groups and clubs to Chinese 
  cooking and Western European architecture. From Wall Street to Hollywood and 
  Baseball to Cricket, it's all yours, and we mean that literally. You'll own 
  it and the revenue that is generated from every feature will be paid to you!</p>
<p>&quot;Ownership&quot; in the Going Platinum Community is like owning a television 
  network, newspaper, magazine, shopping mall, sports arena, real estate or travel 
  agency and about 100 different billboards all at the same time. It is an income 
  generating opportunity in so many ways.<br>
</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#0066FF">It's Your Turn To Cash In!</font></p>
<p><b><font color="#0066FF">Membership in Going Platinum&#153; affords you the 
  opportunity to earn money through 2 uniquely different, yet related programs:</font></b> 
</p>
<p>The GPC (<font color="#0066FF">Going Platinum Community</font>) is a cooperative 
  online community that pays you the &quot;referral fees&quot; and &quot;commissions&quot; 
  that you and your friends' presence on the Internet generate. It is designed 
  to turn every Internet session into an income-producing event.</p>
<p>The GPAP (<font color="#0066FF">Going Platinum Affiliate Program</font>) is 
  our dynamic membership plan that pays you just for participating. It also helps 
  you to earn much, much more in the GPC even if you play the most passive of 
  roles in the program.</p>
