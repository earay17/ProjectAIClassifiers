<BR>
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you=
<BR>
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this<=
BR>
letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an=
<BR>
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see i=
f<BR>
it really can make people money.\\~ The show also investigated whether or =
not<BR>
the program was legal. <BR>
<BR>
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws=
<BR>
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the=
<BR>
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25<=
BR>
out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT T=
HIS <BR>
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. <BR>
<BR>
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I w=
as<BR>
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I<=
BR>
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal=
<BR>
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.=
00<BR>
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New<BR>

Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long<B=

time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in=
<BR>
the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple<BR>
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.<B=
R>
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a<=
BR>
total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the<BR>
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key t=

success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change <BR>
anything.'' More testimonials later but first, <BR>

GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE <BR=

<BR>
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE=
 <BR>
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. <BR>
<BR>
=3D=3D=3D When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 rep=
orts.<BR>
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and=
<BR>
resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=3D$25.00. <BR>
<BR>
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from=
<BR>
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be<=
BR>
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them fr=
om<BR>

BR>
something happen to your computer. <BR>
<BR>
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to<BR=

provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to se=
nd <BR>
bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and m=
uch <BR>
more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: <BR>
<BR>
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY <BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we =
<BR>
will <BR>
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also=
 <BR>
assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could b=
e <BR>
much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send =
out <BR>
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with=
<BR>
this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. <BR>
<BR>
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 peop=
le <BR>
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of <=
BR>
those <BR>
50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=3D100 people respon=
ded <BR>
and ordered Report # 2. <BR>
<BR>
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mail=
s.<BR>
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. <BR>
<BR>
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million<BR>
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # =
4.<BR>
<BR>
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000<=
BR>
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Repo=
rt<BR>
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000.00 (half million). <BR>
<BR>
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....<BR=
>
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=3D$555,550.=
00 <BR>
<BR>
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE=
 <BR>
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF=
 <BR>
MONEY ! <BR>
<BR>

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D <BR>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU=
 <BR>
MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or hal=
f <BR>
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There =
are <BR>
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me=
, <BR>
many people will do just that, and more! <BR>

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of =
<BR>
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will <=
BR>
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # =
1 <BR>
and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must=
 do <BR>
is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day=
 <BR>
service on all orders. <BR>
<BR>
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and addr=
ess <BR>
on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive th=
