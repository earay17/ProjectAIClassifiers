<BR>
I have been <B> beating Slot Machines</B>  in casinos and cruise ships<BR>
all over the world for years, while they pay for my <B> VIP priviledges<BR>
</B> including, travel, meals and lodging, all while I am taking their money.<BR>
<BR>
<B> SO CAN YOU!!<BR>
</B> <BR>
Every slot machine has a secret <B> mechanical flaw</B> , and once I reveal to you<BR>
how this "Flaw" works, <B> you will</B>  be able to walk into any gaming hall, <B> anywhere</B> , <BR>
and <B> "Win"</B> .  Period!<BR>
<BR>
I am willing to <B> share my secret </B> with only a small group of people, as I do not <BR>
want to create any appreciable change in the industries' "Take".<BR>
<BR>
The information on the Web Site <B> is worth 10 minutes</B>  of your <BR>
free time, especially if you are <B> tired of</B>  watching everyone else win and<BR>
all <B> you</B>  ever seem to do is <B> donate your hard earned wages!</B> <BR>
  <BR>
All the information can be found at: <B> http://www.askthepros.cc </B>   <BR>

Thank-you for your time.<BR>
