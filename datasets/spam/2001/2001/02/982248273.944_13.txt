 SUCCESS IS A MATTER OF EXPECTATION.
  ----------------------------------------------

 You must first expect to succeed, if you want to succeed.
 You can't expect to succeed beyond your wildest expectations
 unless you begin with some pretty wild expectations.

 Set your goals high.
 You'll find that when you expect good things to happen,
 strangely enough, they will happen.
 Your expectation will energize your goals and give them momentum.
 Your life will always respond to your outlook.

 The dreams you choose to believe in come to be.
 When you believe something good can happen, it does.
