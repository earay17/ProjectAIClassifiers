legally and lawfully?  This works for the W2 earner, business person, <BR>
or anyone who is tired of paying too much in taxes.<BR>

Would you like to liberate your IRA without taxes or penalties?<BR>
We can do that too.<BR>
<BR>
If your problem is before the year 1997 bankruptcy may be an option<BR>
that your "tax attorney" failed to mention to you.<BR>
<BR>
We may be able to help you be uncollectable without bankruptcy.<BR>
<BR>
We may be able to stop all forms of collection.<BR>
<BR>
This is not any traditional information you have heard of, in fact<BR>
most attorneys urge you to negotiate with the IRS...that is clearly<BR>
not what we are about.  Our goal is to stop all activity against you period.<BR>
