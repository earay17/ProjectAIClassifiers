<p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#000000">Unlike others we do not buy
list and re-sell them.&nbsp; Currently at our company, we command a state of
the art harvesting and extraction department. This department consist of 21
computers and over $28,000 worth of the most advanced extracting and harvesting software
designed by a computer science graduate of MIT. He now
works here with us at GlobalWeb Inc. Also running this department are 5 computer technicians
3 of whom have Bachelors Degrees in Computer Science.&nbsp; This unique
software developed by GlobalWeb is currently unavailable to the general public.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial">These lists harvested
and extracted from 2/9/01 to 2/14/01 that consist of
300,000 addresses each are available
for a&nbsp; short time only. No list will be sold more than three times. After
this list has been sold we will move on to our next extraction.&nbsp;
We have no intention on saturating the Internet with the same list that we use
ourselves.&nbsp; Our list were extracted from 26 major domains
that are known for high sales ratios currently
residing on the Internet.&nbsp; They also include 17 domains affiliated with a
world wide shopping arena with one of the highest Internet sales
rates in the world, EBAY. Also, these list have been seeded with brand new AOL addresses.
(FYI) When delivering AOL addresses utilizing mixed list, AOL deliverability is
approximately 89% successful.<br>

    Our addresses have been cleaned, SMTP tested for delivery and verified by URL
    and domain&nbsp; with an 8 step&nbsp; inspection process&nbsp; before we allow
    them to be
    utilized.&nbsp; We also
    run our addresses through a remove list compiled by our e-marketing company over
    a 3 year period of time.&nbsp; Any addresses extracted with inappropriate or
    profane wording are eliminated. And finally, we have sorted the list into
    easy to utilize clusters of 300,000 addresses in easy to split, merge or
    separate text format
    that will work with any bulk mailing software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
