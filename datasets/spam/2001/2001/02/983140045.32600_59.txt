First Aid Direct, Inc. (OTC-BB FADI) provides a complete line of
industrial first aid and safety products that meet or exceed OSHA
requirements. First Aid Direct is 40% owned by Van Dyne Crotty, 
which is one of the top ten uniform rental companies in the U.S. 
and one of the top five privately owned companies in the country.

Financial Facts and Reasons to Own Stock in this Company

FADI products are trademarked and proprietary.

FADI is in an acquisition phase, building one of the fastest growing first
aid & safety products companies in the industry.  FADI, along with Van Dyne
Crotty, has an AGGRESSIVE ACQUISITION POLICY to gain market share.  Current
FADI Board members have successfully built a company like this before,
taking Van Dyne Crotty from start to annual sales exceeding $120 million.

FADI became operationally PROFITABLE during 2000, but may post a year-end
loss due to accounting and legal expenses associated with its Form 10-SB
registration with the SEC.

FADI is only 3 years old and is one of the FASTEST GROWING manufacturers and
distributors of first aid products in the US. The First Aid Safety industry
is a MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR business with annual growth exceeding 20%.

First Aid Direct has access to Van Dyne Crotty’s customer base, to market
its product lines, which numbers approach 30,000. Van Dyne Crotty has
entered into a long-term agreement to purchase all of its first aid products
from First Aid Direct. This partnership with Van Dyne Crotty will enable
First Aid Direct to become a major force in the commercial first aid and
safety business.

FADI being part of first aid & safety sector and is a SOLID INVESTMENT in a
slow growth or recessionary environment or in a booming environment.

FADI offers first aid distributors and uniform suppliers competitive access
to the first aid suppliers market without giving up their independence and
flexibility compared to other wholesalers in the industry who require
business restrictions on their distributor customers. The FADI business
model not only allows distributors to remain independent but also they can
become an owner by purchasing stock in First Aid Direct through the stock
market. This alternative will build a very strong network of first aid
distributors.

ATTRACTIVE MARKET VALUATION.  FADI is currently trading at only 3.96 times
book value and 1.40 times sales coupled with gross profit margins in excess
of 30%, which means this stock is undervalued. With additional acquisitions
and strategic alliances the stock price should increase to $10.00 per share.
