Those Meeting These Unusual Requirements May Qualify For
$10,000 To $156,000 in Free Grants
 
     *No Interest Charges *No Credit Checks * Never Repay
Could you use a Free Grant of $10,000 to $156,000 but, not 
exceeding $5,000,000?
If so, it is very important that you read every word of this Free 
Grant Announcement.
New programs, funded by the U.S.Government, and private 
foundations, allows only
certain people that meet unusual requirements a Free Grant. In the 
past, only the select
few were privy to these funds. But this has all changed. Free 
Grants are being paid in
amounts up to, but not exceeding, $5,000,000 U.S.dollars. The 
relatively new concept of
giving away money is called the Free Grant Giveaway Program. Now 
what really makes
these special programs different is who is eligible for these 
special Free Grants. Common
everyday people are getting these funds on a daily basis. It seems 
hard to believe, but it's
the absolute truth.
No longer are Free Grants the domain of the privileged and choice 
few, but now they can
be awarded to everyday people like you. Special preferential 
treatment for those receiving
grants is not tolerated at all. All applicants are treated equal 
regardless of race, creed,
financial situation or credit stability. Once you have been 
accepted to receive a Free
Grant, you should follow certain guidelines. Use the money to 
start a new business, pay
off old debts, clean up your credit rating, or use these funds for 
just about any other
purpose. It will be your choice which investment or venture to 
invest in. Once you have
qualified for the Free Grant, nothing can stop the funds from 
being delivered to your home
by certified mail. With these, you will never need to pay back the 
money, ever. It's yours
to keep for the rest of your life, and the best part is you will 
never have to answer to
anyone! Not one penny ever has to be returned. It's all yours to 
keep forever.
This is a limited offer for all those in need of a Free Grant. And 
those that qualify will be
eligible for up to but, not exceeding $5,000,000. Before I tell 
you more, let's make sure you
are not wasting your time. You see they don't just give anyone a 
Free Grant, certain
people qualify for this money. Those that don't meet this 
criteria, need not apply for these
funds. If they do they will just be wasting their time. These 
special Free Grant Companies
are set up to assist those in our society that are unable to 
secure money through
conventional means. Someone has to help those in need, and they 
are set up to do just
that. Those applying for a Free Grant must not have a total net 
worth that exceeds
$250,000 and all applicants must be at least 18 years of age.
These are genuine programs offering money to those candidates that 
meet their eligibility
criteria. Everything in this announcement is perfectly legal and 
the verifiable, honest truth.
The best thing about the Free Grant Program is that it requires: 
No credit checks, No
credit history information, No co-signers, No collateral, No 
employment checks, No income
verification, No higher education and even No special skills. But, 
they do require that you
have a valid Social Security Number for tax purposes. Once you 
receive a Free Grant, you
must disclose the amount of funds you received to the U.S. 
Government. The Free Grants
they disperse are not tax-free. Money they send you must be 
declared on form 1099 to the
I.R.S. and it is the responsibility of the recipient of the Free 
Grant to declare his or her
earnings to the proper government authorities.
Normally all I would need is your name, address and other 
pertinent information to get your
order processed. I would love to do this absolutely free for 
everyone who need this money,
but I just can't afford to do that. I am asking for a nominal fee 
of just $39.95 to process your
order. By asking for a nominal $39.95 fee.
I am able to cover my initial expenses as well as being able to 
filter
out those that just want to take advantage of my generosity. 
Besides, those that can't
afford this measly fee will probably squander the Free Grant money 
on something
