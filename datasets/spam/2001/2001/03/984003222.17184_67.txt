Free Post Launch

There are a number of important factors that increase the chances of any net 
worker becoming successful. The most important of which is the momentum and excitement 
of actively sponsoring new members.

How would you like to know that you have an existing down line and team in place 
to continue to help you develop a network BEFORE you ever sign up or invest a 
penny?

With our Post Launch program you can!

Post Launch is similar to a pre launch with two main differences. Post Launch 
places a large group of excited individuals into an established Marketing program 
instead of a Marketing plan that may only be testing the waters. (80% of new 
MLM's go defunct in the first year of business).

Secondly, our program uses a new TEAM concept to help you to build a network. 
There is absolutely no risk to get involved and no cost to join Post Launch.

You have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain!

Wishing you Health, Happiness and Success

Michael Saville

PS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE CREATED THE MOST POWERFUL OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE TODAY AND 
THAT OUR PLAN WILL BECOME THE MODEL FOR THE INDUSTRY IN THE YEARS TO COME!

BE PREPARED TO GET EXCITED...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

This is a one time e-mail transmission.
