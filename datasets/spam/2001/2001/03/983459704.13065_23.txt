I would like to introduce Watkins Web Trak, a completely web-based help
desk solution to help your company manage its service and support calls.
This application integrates with your existing Intranet or Extranet so
all your employees have access to the same database. It may also be used
on the Internet to track call history for your external customers.
Watkins Web Trak is a collection of Active Server Pages therefore
customizing the application is as simple as changing the source code. It
requires a web server with ASP support and an ODBC connection to your
database. We bundle a functional Microsoft Access database and a
Microsoft SQL 7.0 schema file to build the tables required by the
application. Additional features of the application include:
*	100% Customizable
*	Unlimited Security Levels
*	Quick and easy form submission
*	Workgroup and Technician level service reports
*	Dynamic customized reports
*	Print-and-go service request details
*	On-line administration of drop-down lists
*	On-line user profile administration
*	Asset tracking in user profiles
*	Six (6) months of support and upgrades
