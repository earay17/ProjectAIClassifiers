Are you DISAPPOINTED and FRUSTRATED with your on-line
marketing efforts?  

My name is Paul Willis and I am one of the few who 
have managed to make a very comfortable living marketing 
products on the Internet.  My methods and techniques have 
been quoted in magazines, radio talk shows, the Nov. 27th 
issue of the Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Post 
just to name a few. 

I have marketed everything on the Internet from 
Personalized Baby Calendars to Information and have 
made money with everything.  Even the Wall Street Journal
referred to me as being crafty in my techniques that have 
out maneuvered the anti commerce radicals since 1995.  

I am one of the reasons these same radicals have failed to 
fulfill there dream of controlling Free Enterprise and 
making the Internet there own little private parlor.

************************************************************

The secret to an effective bulk E-mail marketing campaign
on the internet is directly related to the freshness of the
lists used.  To ensure that our customers receive the 
freshest mailing addresses, we're constantly updating and
revising our mailing lists.  NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME we 
are making these lists available for purchase.

"MASTER MARKETERS CD VOL. 1" consists of 20 Million 
E-mail addresses that were cleaned and verified to be 
100% deliverable as of 2/8/001.  You can start mailing
these addresses immediately.  You get 865 clean and 
verified files of addresses, totaling over 20 Million clean
Fresh and verified Addresses.

We have removed all the following domains.

THESE DOMAINS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT INCLUDED:
Compuserve.com
Genie.com
Delphi.com
MCI.com
All domains ending with .edu,, .mil., .org., and .us
There are no International domains in this CD.
All addresses are pure .COM AND .NET.

There are ABSOLUTELY NO DUPICATE ADDRESSES! 

Our CD does not contain any of the bogus and filled 
addresses used by other companies to ad inflated numbers
to their lists.  We mail over 15 million direct E-mails 
per week for our clients and the addresses contained in
the "Master Marketers CD" are the same fresh, clean lists. 

We maintain a huge database of anti-commerce radicals who
want the net for themselves.  We run our lists against this 
database and remove all E-mail addresses these radicals use
to trap you into mailing to them so they can cause you 
trouble.

Over 30,000 BUSINESSES come on the Internet EVERY single
day ... If you don't send out Broadcast Email, YOUR 
COMPETITON WILL!  We know ... we mail for dozens of 
companies every month that already do.
