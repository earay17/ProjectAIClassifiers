<p>Dear Windows User,<br>
<br>
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows ME, 95 and 98&nbsp;<br>
to<br>
nearly the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and&nbsp;
<br>
industrial version of Windows.<br>
<br>
The new <font color="#FF0000"> WinFix</font> is a very effective way to 
improve the reliability of<br>
Windows, because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing.&nbsp;
<br>
And<br>
<font color="#FF0000">
WinFix</font> is very safe, because it operates completely independent 
of&nbsp;<br>
Windows.<br>
<br>

<font face="Arial" size="2"> </font> </span>to find out more about <font 
color="#FF0000"> WinFix</font> the safest,<br>
most effective way to keep you working,<br>
by keeping your PC working non-stop.<br>
