The Market has given back all of its gains from December 1998. Interest ra=
tes have been cut for the third time in the past 2-month period. Just like=
 the market failed to pay attention to the rate increase last year they ar=
e not responding to the rate drops as of this date this year. We believe i=
n buying while the blood is still on the street. This is a great buying op=
portunity. Historically speaking small caps make a much faster return to f=
orm then large caps at the end of a bear market. We believe that we have i=
solated one such situation in Merilus Technologies, Inc. (MERH)<BR><BR>
THE OPPORTUNITY:The stock that we are currently recommending is (OTCBB: ME=
RH) Merilus Technologies, Inc. Hardly a week passes without a major news s=
tory on an Internet security breach. Last year 80% of U.S. companies were =
attached with a destructive virus. The number of U.S. companies spending m=
ore than $1 million per year on IT security doubled in the past 12 months,=
 with corporate security budgets up 188% in the past two years. Merilus Te=
chnologies, Inc. delivers intelligent products that simplify the process o=
f digital security, which are less expensive, more robust and easier to us=
e than competitive systems. In a soaring worldwide market with no dominant=
 players, Merilus is focusing on the $8 billion small to medium sized comp=
any segment and is bound to capture significant share. Turning profitable =
this year, the Company is forecasing healthly returns and impressive growt=
h that make it an extremely attractive investment.<BR><BR>
