Some Comments From Our Users: 

"I recently purchased the online version 
of this software from you because I wanted to 
know if my husband was still cheating on me. 
Sure enough, he was. I got the proof I needed 
less than 24 hours after I had made the purchase. 
-J. Gills 
Los Angeles, California 


"I wanted to let you know that I have 
had your product for a year now. It 
is the best money I have ever spent. 
It's easy to install, HIDE, and 
use. 


I am not really computer literate 
when it comes to using and installing 
programs but this one is easy. You can 
monitor anyone who uses the computer and 
play it back just like videotape. 


It really takes a picture of any screen they 
are on from start up to sign off. IM's, 
chat rooms, web sites, letters, even if 
they run scan disk or something. 


I highly recommend this product especially 
if you have children on the web." 
-M. Eubanks 
Vicksburg, Mississippi 


"Great Product. Easy to use. Easy to 
change options. A breeze to install. 
-Patricia MacDougall 
Victoria BC, Canada 


"Helps me keep my employees honest and on 
task." 


-A. Shupp 
Sisters, Oregon 


"My two daughters are 8 and 10 and love 
to get on the Internet. I do not always 
have the time to be looking over their 
shoulders, so now I feel so much reassured 
that even though I cannot be there at every 
minute, I know every minute what they have been 
doing." 
-L. Mathis 
Jacksonville, Florida 


"If we could have only one program on my 
computer, yours would be it. We love it!" 
-J. Rogers 
Wilmington, North Carolina 


"This is a definite must for the office PC... 
increases productivity." 
-G. Blackwell 
Charleston, South Carolina 


"The product is pretty slick. Does what it promises." 
-V. Shettigar 
San Jose, California 


"The problem with blocker programs is that they can't 
block it all. Your software proves useful because it 
doesn't have to block the site, it just keeps 
everyone accountable for their own actions. 
Great product." 
-R. DeBok 
Kansas City, Kansas 


"It works great. Gives me peace of mind 
by being able to check where my kids have 
been on the Web. Thanks." 
-G. Savage 
Tucson, Arizona 


"Wonderful tool to monitor children on Internet, 
to know where they go!" 
-J. Denison

Your product is great. THANKS"
