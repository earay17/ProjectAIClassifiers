This is an invitation for you to review the newest concepts in both
Shopping and Investing. Visit our web site at
http://specialtysalesonline.com/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?52616e646f6d495692206e041d748a6512dd87d49079a0f0ec8e03d38db88d1e and
review these concepts to see if they fit into your style. Click on the
link to seamlessly explore.

SHOPPING: Each month SpecialtyOnlineSales.com will present a category of
products (usually four to six items), direct from the manufacturer to
you. There will be a limited quantity of these items available for a
limited time. You can review and make a selection by clicking onto our
store at Yahoo.com. Your purchase will be shipped directly to your home
or office. Then, each month, we will send you an e-mail itemizing the
newest selections.

INVESTING: Are you an online investor? Do you want to gain an edge on
the big boys? SpecialtyOnlineSales.com is a clearinghouse for an
Investing Consortium. You still do all of your own investing and handle
all of your own money, but you do it in consort with many other club
members. SOS2001.net is a consortium of independent traders interested
in maximizing their investment potential by acting as a collective
block. Volume of trading can influence price and subsequent
participation. Click on our site to review this newest concept.
