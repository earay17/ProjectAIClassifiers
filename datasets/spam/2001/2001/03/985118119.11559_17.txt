Hello! My name is Betty Wilson and I would like to share my experience as =
an inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope. <BR>
<BR>
It's amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simply=
 don't want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight problem for the b=
etter part of a decade. <BR>
<BR>
<B>My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the r=
efrigerator. </B><BR>
<BR>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked=
. At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or ener=
gy to respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder _ If that =
thin, sexy, woman, in that short black dress _ was really me? (My husband =
proposed to me in that dress 10 years ago) I didn't even feel like that ha=
ppy woman in the picture - I was exhausted and so depressed. <BR>
<BR>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I wa=
s too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I=
 was tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day. <BR>
<BR>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting "care=
er." Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, & even Phen-Phen, a=
nd the list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few days, then it w=
as only a matter of time until I reached my breaking point and ended up ea=
ting vast quantities of the very foods I'd been denying myself. <B><U>NOTH=
ING </B></U>worked for me until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try =
a product that was nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That prod=
uct was called <B>Berry Trim Plus.</B> <BR>
<BR>
After about five days on BerryTrim Plus, I began to experience a sense of =
"well being" with increased energy - I didn't feel tired, irritable or slu=
ggish. More Importantly, <B>I didn't feel Hungry</B> - something I hadn't =
felt for months, maybe years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>I've been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought  =
I had tried everything when... </B><BR>

Today, I can do many activities that I couldn't when I weighed 282 pounds.=
 <U>The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was!</U> My doctor has =
examined me, and <B>my weight loss has blown his mind!</B> People that I u=
sed to work with and even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas!=
 I truly wish everyone who is overweight knew about this program ... I pla=
n to tell everyone I can who has struggled with his or her weight, like I =
have. I can feel your pain, believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the Berry=
Trim Plus program! It has given me a new lease on life_ <B>After losing 12=
6 pounds so far, I feel very confident, happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I re=
cently wore that same black cocktail dress I wore when my husband proposed=
 - 10 years ago!</B> <I>(I guess that woman in the picture really was me!)=
</I> I thought I would never look and feel like that again! <BR>
<BR>
<B>BerryTrim Plus is a powerful gift from nature that has touched every as=
pect of my life!</B> And from the bottom of my heart, I will always thank =
my dear friend Judy for telling me about this wonderful product and giving=
 me back the joy of living.<BR>
<BR>

I was sick of being fat. I didn't like the way I looked and I didn't like =
the way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my four children,and =
myself to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you need to lose a few =
pounds, more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, click through this w=
ebsite thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for s=
o many people like you and me!.<BR>
<BR>
The proof is in the <I>pudding </I>(so to speak) so take a look at the man=
y success stories from others who have gained better health, improved thei=
r relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it off for goo=
d. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this is someth=
ing you are willing to try _ <B>GO FOR IT!!!!! </B>You won't be sorry.. Do=
 take the time to read them. Many are simply <B>AMAZING!</B><BR>
