Dear Friend,

My name is Robert Klein.  I am the Dean of the University of Advanced Research - Hawaii.  I am writing you today in hopes that I may assist you in the pursuit of higher education.  

If you knew that you could finish college in six to ten months, earn a Bachelor's, Master's or Doctorate, become a part of the lucrative world of upper crest business or the explosive computer programming industry, would you want to find out more about our school?   Did you know that you could earn your undergraduate or graduate degree via multi-media CD-ROM or with self-grading online quizzes?  Our graduates include elected officials, Foreign Dignitaries, college professors, doctors, lawyers and dentists.  Fortune 100 companies have hired our graduates and most gain employment within 30 - 60 days of earning their degrees.

UAR's curriculums are dynamic.  Each program incorporates the most recent and the most relevant business and computer science CD-ROM's and/or textbooks.   With our distance learning curriculums, you study from home and learn at your own pace.  My staff provides help and support seven days a week.  You could earn your Bachelor's Degree or your Master's Degree for less than $800.00 or if you are the "techie" type, earn your Master of Computer Science or Doctorate of Philosophy in Computer Science at a very reasonable cost.

The University of Advanced Research - Hawaii (UAR) is a 100% Distance Learning Institution of Higher Education.  UAR is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education - National Center for Education Statistics I.D.#(434654).   For over ten years, UAR has helped working adults pursue higher education. UAR pioneered the Self-Teaching-Curriculum more than ten years ago.  Well known educational institutions adopted methods similar to UAR's to teach their off-campus students. 

With seven exciting degree disciplines, high quality, employer respectability, employer acceptability, and low cost, UAR is recognized as a leader in distance learning.   Our student body and alumni span the globe.  From nearly every U.S. State to many foreign countries, UAR's distance learning programs help hard working adults achieve educational... and thereafter financial success. 

I am sure that you have heard the old maxim "Knowledge Is Power."   Well, it is certainly as true today as when the phrase was first penned an estimated 600 years ago.   Does your supervisor have more education than those he or she supervises?  Does a lawyer have more education than a paralegal?  The formula is simple: [EDUCATION (equals) OPPORTUNITY (equals) MONEY (equals) POWER (equals) RESPECT (equals) OPPORTUNITY (equals) MONEY (equals) POWER (equals) RESPECT...] and it never ends.    You see, it is undeniably and irrefutably true. Conversely, the lack of education begets the exact opposite result (Newton's Law of Relativity).

Take for example the new President of Harvard University.  He was the youngest professor ever to gain tenure (28 years of age). He graduated with a Ph.D., from Harvard in 1982. He became the U.S. Treasury Secretary and on March 11, 2001, at 46 years of age, Harvard named him as their new President.  Go back, read the formula, and then re-read this paragraph. Read and then re-read each a dozen times or more, or until the two previous paragraphs become one congruent thought.  Not everyone aspires to become the President of Harvard.  UAR can help you find your position somewhere between "Top-Notch" and "Blue Chip"... and that's a fact!

A good education should not be reserved for those with unlimited finances or the proper contacts or the right pedigree or the highest test scores (most IQ test are considered biased).   Education, in the United States, is a constitutional right, not a privilege (our oldest student is 79 years old).  You are entitled to the best education available. If you remove the exorbitant costs, you get a simple, direct, lean, affordable and high quality education.  That is exactly what UAR accomplished over a decade ago.    

Today, I am going to help you achieve your academic goals.  Essentially, I will walk you through to earning your degree, thereby helping you to improve your standard of living via a successful education. My staff and I will provide you with phenomenal assistance.   Perhaps your standard of living suits you well and your desire is to bring closure to your academic ambitions. I can help you do that too.  

You are important.  I offer special incentives and help matriculating students with their tuition once each year. I am able to provide these special incentives to a limited, albeit select audience. I will help you now if you will let me.

Below, you will find a special Password and Username.  Commit them to memory because in a few moments, you will need to use them to gain access to a very special web page. 
====================
Password: incentives
UserName: 2001
====================
If you click on this link http://212.250.240.160/2001/2001-Incentives.shtml, I will guide you to a very special area of the university's website.  We reserve this "by-invitation-only" area for those whom we contact directly.  No one else has access to the information available on this very special page.

Now, what I can do to help is limited to time and the size of my administrative and support staff.  I can provide a substantial 50% tuition discount.  However, after Friday, March 30, 2001 I must retract this incentive.  Consequently, you should immediately go to the information page.  Once you arrive, you will need to input the Password and Username exactly as they appear above.  It is a good idea for you to print this very personal letter first.  That way, you will have the Password and Username at your fingertips.

Because I trust that you really want to go to college and EARN your degree, I have petitioned my Board of Regents on your behalf.  I requested and received authorization to provide you with a few well-deserved financial assurances.

The Regents authorized me to allow you to "test drive" the Master's of Business Administration (MBA) or the Bachelor of Arts in English (B.Eng.) programs for 15 days FREE OF CHARGE.  My distribution center will send you the first CD-ROM course of either program you choose. Keep the CD-ROM for 15 days, view the multi-media tutorials, sit in the virtual classrooms, listen to professors from accredited colleges explain the topics, watch full color video right on your computer, take the on-screen quizzes and see first hand what distance learning really represents.  Best of all there are no gimmicks whatsoever!  Just register at the site and we will handle the rest.  My Registrar will perform an "authorization only" on your credit card. That assures me that should you decide to earn your degree at UAR, that there are sufficient resources on your credit card.  However, no charge will occur until the 16th day.

If for any reason, you are not thoroughly and completely satisfied with the CD-ROM course, or you are not thrilled with the prospect of earning your degree at UAR, or you do not enjoy the power of the curriculums and their easy to use graphical interfaces, or if the color of the envelope in which you receive your first course just "bugs" you, simply fax the included cancellation letter to me.  However, if you like what you see, I will instruct the Registrar to process your registration on day 16 and Officially Enroll You At The University Of Advanced Research - Hawaii.

There is more!  Regardless of what you decide, you may keep the first course as my gift.  What you learn from the first course will last you a lifetime.  Someday, I would hope to see your name on our Alumni Roster. In the meantime, keep the course and enjoy your peek at higher education.

This special "test drive" is specifically for the Bachelor of Arts in English or the Master of Business Administration programs.  I do not offer this "test drive" to the general public.  Thus, you will notice a different warranty at the website.  Keep this letter as your proof that you are on a "test drive" at no charge.

My friend, time is of the essence.  I will discontinue my special assistance incentives on Friday, March 30, 2001 or sooner.   Because I must ensure that every student receives first-class support, and if my staff becomes inundated with matriculating students, I will discontinue the incentives before Friday, March 30, 2001. Again, I encourage you to pursue your dream.  We all need a little help periodically.  I will help you pursue your dream if you will let me.


Sincerely,


Robert Klein, Ph.D.

P.S. Although this letter is yours, if you absolutely can not benefit from my help and assistance, pass your letter on to a loved one, friend or colleague. I assure you that he or she will thank you forever.
