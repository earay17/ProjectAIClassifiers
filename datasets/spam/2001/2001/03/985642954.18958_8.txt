FROM : MRS ELIZABETH NKEIRU-MANI

RE : MONEY TRANSFER.

Dear Sir, 

I know my message will come to you as a surprise.
Don’t worry I was totally convinced to write you in
reference of the transfer of US$23 M to your account
for onward investment (hotel industries) in your
country. I am Mrs ELIZABETH NKEIRU MANI the second
wife of the former chief of defence-staff late General
HANIS MANI MANI of Guinea Bissau. My late husband was
killed just last year December following his role as a
rebel leader against the past government of Guinea
Bissau as of 1998. Following this political crisis, we
were forced to leave our country to Abidjan the
capital city of Cote d’Ivoire for our life sake. It is
here in Abidjan he deposited this said money in a
private security company as a family valuables. We got
to know about this information and as well able to
recover all the relevant documents regards to this
deposits through his foreign adviser here in Abidjan.
If you are thus and truly disposed to assist us in
transferring of this fund kindly write me through my
e-mail address. More information about the lifting of
this funds legally follows immediately after your and
positive reply. 

NB: Please kindly contact my son JAMES with interest
on phone number (225) 07-60-29-61.

Thank “you for your maximum co-operation.

MRS ELIZABETH NKEIRU MANI For the family.
