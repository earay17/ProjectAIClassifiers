Dear bruceg@em.ca,

Dear Future Millionaires!

Make over a half million dollars every 6 to 9 months from your home for an investment of only a $20 dollar(U.S.) one time expense... THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!

---------------------------------------------

YOU CAN BE A MILLIONARE JUST LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR! Before you write this program off as "Bull", please read the following. This is the letter that you have been hearing about on the news lately.

"Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet"!!

Due to the popularity of this letter, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to investigate this program's money-making ability and its legality. Their findings were conclusive that there are "absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow simple instructions, they are bound to make a lot of
money for a little out of pocket cost". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. PARTICIPATE IN THIS ONE NOW; IT JUST GOT STARTED MARCH OF 2001.

---------------------------------------------

TESTIMONIALS:

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled To Jody about receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lie the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $147,200... ALL CASH! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby".

Mitchell W., Chicago, Illinois

Here are the instructions on how to make a guaranteed $10,000 CASH(U.S) in the next 2 weeks:

There are 4 addresses listed below.

Send each person on the list a $5 bill (Be sure to securely wrap it in 2 pieces of paper), along with a note that says; "Please add me to your mailing list". Also include your e-mail address for future mailings and courtesy follow ups.

Then delete the name at the top of the list, move the other 3 up and put your name at the bottom.

Now send the entire NEW e-mail back out to people. The more e-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive. If each person sends out 100 e-mails, there will be over 1,000,000 people that receive this letter when your name reaches the top. If only 1% of those people respond, you will still get $10,000 CASH! 

Here is the list:
--------------------------------------------

1. Gabor Toth
   PO Box 41
   Ozona, FL 34660
   USA

2. Sylvia Palhazy
   PO Box 724
   Palm Harbor, FL 34682
   USA

3. John Thunder
   PO Box 1692
   Dunedin, FL 34697
   USA

4. Agnes Cseke
   PO Box 5835
   Clearwater, FL 33758
   USA

--------------------------------------------

THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO! When your name reaches the top in a few days, you will start receiving $5 bills from other people just like yourself, who are willing to invest a $5 bill to receive $10,000 CASH.

Nothing ventured, nothing gained...
