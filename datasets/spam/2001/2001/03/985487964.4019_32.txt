I found a great new Internet company - CashFiesta.com that 
has created a product that everyone can benefit from. They 
pay you while you work or play on your computer. They even 
pay you when your friends are using their computers. It's 
free to join and your privacy is completely protected.

Their proprietary software - the FiestaBar - displays ads 
at the bottom or top of your computer screen. Since advertisers 
want you to view these ads, they pay CashFiesta to reach you 
via The FiestaBar and then CashFiesta shares its advertising 
revenues with you. Members who use the FiestaBar are paid 
for their own Web browsing and for referrals.

All you have to do is sign up and start making money. It only 
takes a minute. You can refer your friends, family and co-workers 
and you will receive a percentage of their earnings in addition 
to your own.

So here is the link, enjoy and happy money making to all of you.
