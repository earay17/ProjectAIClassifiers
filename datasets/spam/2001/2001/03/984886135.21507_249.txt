Dear bruceg,
Recently I received an email that made me sit up and pay attention! This
was the ONE that FINALLY HIT ME!
This system is entirely different, and it is so EASY to run!
I assure you; with this program you can earn a potential 5-figure monthly
income on a ten-dollar budget, at home, in your spare time.

The company teaches us how to become successful with ANY business on or off
the Internet with their Monthly Web Marketing Magazine and their
comprehensive on line training course.

If I can do this, ANYONE can!

I promise you, if you set aside a little time each day or two to send an
email similar to this and a follow up letter to only those who ask you for
more info, YOU WILL MAKE
MONEY.

This is positively the best moneymaking opportunity I have EVER seen, and
it's SO AFFORDABLE to join!! Get started right now! I will help you.

To your success,
Art Hagar
FREE Web Marketing Magazine at the web site. Be sure to request your

Thanks - Art
P.S.bruceg,
I have recently purchased the rights to distribute TERRY DEAN'S Ebook,
"The Best of Web Gold". This excellent Ebook has over 75 training
articles teaching you step-by-step how to build an Internet Business. I will
email you this book FREE of charge if you will send me an email with
GOLD in the subject.
I am doing this to show that if you join with me in the LEAP business
that I will help you build a successful At Home Internet Business.
Having an Up line that is willing to help you grow your business is sometimes
90% of the success rate. And even if you don't join it is called
"People Helping People". I will still send you your copy anyway. "What Goes
Around Comes Around" is a motto I believe in?
REMEMBER: GOLD in the subject
Thank you for your time,
Art Hagar
