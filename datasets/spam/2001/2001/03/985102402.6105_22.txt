Hello! My name is Betty Wilson and I would like to share my experience as an 
inspiration to many who may feel there is no hope. <BR>
<BR>
It’s amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simply 
don’t want to face up to. I managed to ignore my weight problem for the better 
part of a decade. <BR>
<BR>
		<B>My life was going from the bed to the sofa and from the sofa to the 
refrigerator. </B><BR>
<BR>
Food was my escape, and the weight piled on until I hated the way I looked. 
At my top weight of 282 pounds, I felt worthless, with no desire or energy to 
respond to life. I would look at old pictures, and wonder — If that thin, sexy,
 woman, in that short black dress — was really me? (My husband proposed to me 
in that dress 10 years ago) I didn’t even feel like that happy woman in the 
picture – I was exhausted and so depressed. <BR>
<BR>
My husband, who had been caring for me and our four children (because I was 
too big), was genuinely concerned about my physical and mental health. I was 
tired - very tired, of the struggle to make it through each day. <BR>
<BR>
I have been on every diet you can think of during my lengthy dieting "career.
" Diet Center, NutriSystem, Slim Fast, Atkins Diet, & even Phen-Phen, and the 
list goes on and on. I would diet for the first few days, then it was only a 
matter of time until I reached my breaking point and ended up eating vast 
quantities of the very foods I’d been denying myself. <B><U>NOTHING 
</B></U>worked for me until a dear friend of ours convinced me to try a 
product that was nutritionally engineered for maximum results. That product 
was called <B>Berry Trim Plus.</B> <BR>
<BR>
After about five days on BerryTrim Plus, I began to experience a sense of 
"well being" with increased energy - I didn’t feel tired, irritable or 
sluggish. More Importantly, <B>I didn't feel Hungry</B> - something I hadn't 
felt for months, maybe years. <BR>
<BR>
		<B>I've been looking for a weight-loss solution for so long. I thought  I 
had tried everything when... </B><BR>

Today, I can do many activities that I couldn't when I weighed 282 pounds. 
<U>The most amazing part - how simple and easy it was!</U> My doctor has 
examined me, and <B>my weight loss has blown his mind!</B> People that I used 
to work with and even family members didn't recognize me at Christmas! I truly 
wish everyone who is overweight knew about this program ... I plan to tell 
everyone I can who has struggled with his or her weight, like I have. I can 
feel your pain, believe me!!! You cannot go wrong on the BerryTrim Plus 
program! It has given me a new lease on life… <B>After losing 126 pounds so 
far, I feel very confident, happy, and even sexy! Oh, and I recently wore that 
same black cocktail dress I wore when my husband proposed - 10 years ago!</B> 
<I>(I guess that woman in the picture really was me!)</I> I thought I would 
never look and feel like that again! <BR>
<BR>
<B>BerryTrim Plus is a powerful gift from nature that has touched every 
aspect of my life!</B> And from the bottom of my heart, I will always thank my 
dear friend Judy for telling me about this wonderful product and giving me 
back the joy of living.<BR>

I was sick of being fat. I didn’t like the way I looked and I didn’t like the 
way I felt. I felt that I owed it to my husband, my four children,and myself 
to make one more attempt at weight loss. If you need to lose a few pounds, 
more than 100 pounds, or anything in between, click through this website 
thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for so many 
people like you and me!.<BR>
<BR>
The proof is in the <I>pudding </I>(so to speak) so take a look at the many 
success stories from others who have gained better health, improved their 
relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it off for good. The 
testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this is something you are 
willing to try — <B>GO FOR IT!!!!! </B>You won't be sorry.. Do take the time 
to read them. Many are simply <B>AMAZING!</B><BR>
