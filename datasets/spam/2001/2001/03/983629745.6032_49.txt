</B><P>These are the words Jesus spoke to one of the most religious men of=
 his day (<B>John 3:1-8).  </B>Nicodemus had come to Jesus one night to in=
quire about His new doctrine.  Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a ruler of the=
 Jews.  He believed in God, he prayed, fasted, tithed, attended worship se=
rvices, read the Scriptures and tried to keep high moral standards.  Yet, =
with all these credentials, Jesus told him he had to be born again in orde=
r to enter the kingdom of God.</P><BR>
<BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">The Word and the Spirit</P><BR>
</B><P>Jesus said, "\'85 Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingd=
om of God."(<B>John 3:3).  "\'85 Unless one is born of water and the Spiri=
t, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5).  </B>Later in the =
book of John he said, <B>"You are already clean because of the word which =
I have spoken to you" (John 15:3).  </B>Paul wrote that Christ gave Himsel=
f to sanctify and cleanse the church with the washing of water by the <B>W=
ORD (Ephesians 5:26).  </B>Peter wrote that we are born again  "\'85 <B>no=
t of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which liv=
es and abides forever, (1 Pet 1:23).  </B>The WORD is the seed that comes =
into your heart and causes faith to grow.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;Not only must you have God's Word in order to be born again, but yo=
u must have God's Spirit.  It is <B>"not by works of righteousness which w=
e have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing o=
f regeneration and renewing of the HOLY SPIRIT" (Titus 3:5).  </P><BR>
</B><P>&#9;There are several ingredients needed in making concrete.  You n=
eed sand, cement, and water primarily.  There is plenty of sand in the des=
ert, but concrete doesn't appear just because it's there.  There is an abu=
ndance of water in the ocean and plenty of sand, but the ocean is not full=
 of concrete.  Likewise in order for you to be saved, the Word and the Spi=
rit must be mixed with repentance and faith in your heart.</P><BR>
<BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Believe and Confess</P><BR>
<P>&#9;"\'85 The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart (that i=
s, the word of faith which we preach): that if you CONFESS with your mouth=
 the Lord Jesus and BELIEVE in your heart that God has raised Him from the=
 dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one BELIEVES unto righteousne=
ss, and with the mouth CONFESSION is made unto salvation" (Rom 10:8-10).</=
P><BR>
</B><P>&#9;Your faith in God's Word is expressed with your heart (believe)=
 and with your mouth (confess).  If you truly believe in your heart that G=
od raised Jesus from the dead, there is no reason you should not be willin=
g to confess him as Lord.  The moment you believe in your heart upon Jesus=
 and confess Him as your Lord and Savior, you are born again.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;<B>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to becom=
e children of God, \{even\} to those who believe in His name," (John 1:12)=
.</P><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Saved by Grace through Faith</P><BR>
</B><P>&#9;There is a mixture of God's grace and power with your will and =
faith.  It is not just all of God, and certainly it is not just all up to =
you.  It takes both GOD'S ABILITY and YOUR WILLINGNESS to bring about the =
new birth.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;"<B>For by grace you have been SAVED through FAITH, and that NOT OF=
 YOURSELVES; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast=
" (Eph 2:8-9).</P><BR>
<P>&#9;</B>We could never be saved except by the pure grace of God.  Man i=
s certainly undeserving according to his own merits.  It is God's power wo=
rking through His Word and Spirit that brings about the new birth.  Yet wi=
thout an attitude of repentance and faith, God's power will not work in a =
man's heart.  Man's will must be obedient to God's will before he can rece=
ive God's blessings.</P><BR>
<BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">A New Creation</P><BR>
<P>&#9;"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old thing=
s have passed away; behold, all things have become new" (2 Cor 5:17).</P><=
BR>
<P>&#9;</B>The new birth makes you a brand new creation.  You are created =
after the image of Jesus Christ <B>(Colossians 3:10).  </B>This is done by=
 RENEWING THE MIND WITH GOD'S WORD, and submitting your body to the author=
ity of that word <B>(Romans 12:2, Ephesians 4:23-24).</P><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Into god's Kingdom</P><BR>
<P>&#9;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partak=
ers of the inheritance of the saints in light: HE HAS DELIVERED US FROM TH=
E POWER OF DARKNESS, AND TRANSLATED US INTO THE KINGDOM OF THE SON OF HIS =
LOVE, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sin=
s" (Col 1:12-14).</P><BR>
<P>&#9;</B>When you are born again, you are taken out of Satan's kingdom o=
f darkness, and you are placed into the kingdom of Jesus, the kingdom of l=
ight.  It is not something you just hope or wish for.  It is fact.  The ch=
ild of God does not have to be lorded over by Satan ever again. <B>"Theref=
ore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed" (John 8:36).</P><=
BR>
</B><BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">The Law of the Spirit of Life in </P><BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Christ Jesus</P><BR>
</B><P>This new kingdom is a spiritual kingdom; but just because salvation=
 is basically a spiritual rebirth does not mean that is has no effect on y=
our body, mind, or everyday living.  It can and should have a great impact=
 on every part of your life.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;In every society, there are certain laws that govern the actions of=
 the inhabitants of that area.  It is the same in spiritual life.  There a=
re laws for those in Satan's kingdom, and there are laws for those in God'=
s kingdom.  The new birth gives you a new law<B>. "THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT O=
F LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS Has made me free from the law of sin and death" Rom=
ans 8:2).</P><BR>
</B><P>&#9;The law of life includes love, joy, peace, happiness, prosperit=
y, abundance, health, contentment, and blessings.  These provisions are ma=
de for the Christian in the New Covenant.  It is law -- spiritual law.  Yo=
u must enforce it in your life.  God will back you.  His Word is true and =
unchanging.</P><BR>
<BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Forgiveness---Remission of Sins</P><BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER"></P><BR>
</B><P>The day you make Jesus your Lord and Savior you are forgiven of all=
 your sins; in fact you were legally forgiven when Jesus gave His life as =
a ransom for you.  But you do not experience that forgiveness until you re=
ceive it by faith.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;Although a person may have committed many sins, the chief sin of th=
e unsaved is NOT BELIEVING ON CHRIST john 16:9).  When a person gets that =
straightened out, the root of the problem is solved.  The blood of Christ =
cleanses the heart the moment a person believes and confesses Him as Savio=
r.  Thus all the past sins are remitted or taken away by the powerful clea=
nsing work of His blood (1John 1:7). "\'85<B>We have redemption through hi=
s blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; (E=
ph 1:7).</P><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Water Baptism</P><BR>
<P>&#9;</B>It is clear from the scriptures that water baptism is important=
 to the believer.  In the Great Commission Jesus told His disciples, "\'85=
<B>He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all=
 creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever doe=
s not believe will be condemned" (Mark 16:15-16).  </B>Matthew records the=
se words of Jesus in the 28<SUP>th</SUP> chapter and the 19<SUP>th</SUP> v=
erse: <B>"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing th=
em in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" </B>Jesus hi=
mself was baptized by John in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:13-17</P><BR>
<P>&#9;At the close of his message on the day of Pentecost, Peter told the=
 Jews, "\'85<B>Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you =
be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you=
 shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:38). </B>Luke Records=
,<B> "Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; (Acts 2:41).<=
/P><BR>
<P>&#9;</B>Paul was baptized after his conversion <B>(Acts 9:18).</B>  He =
later baptized the believers at Ephesus <B>(Acts 19:1-6). </B> Those at Co=
rnelius" house were baptized after they had received the Holy Ghost <B>(Ac=
ts 10:44-48).</B>  The Philippian jailer and all his household were baptiz=
ed after they had believed on Jesus <B>(Acts 16:31-33).</P><BR>
<BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Assurance of Salvation</P><BR>
<P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">"And this is the testimony: that God has given us eter=
nal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who=
 does not have the Son of God does not have life. These things I have writ=
ten to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know th=
at you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name=
 of the Son of God" (I Jn 5:11-13).</P><BR>
</B><P>If you meet the conditions given in God's Word for salvation, you c=
an know you are saved.  God's Word says that you can know.  That is what y=
ou must stand on - His Word - Not your feelings, emotions, church membersh=
ip, high morals, or sincerity.</P><BR>
<BR>
<B><P ALIGN=3D"CENTER">Pray this prayer out loud.</P><BR>
<P>&#9;Heavenly Farther, in Jesus' name I repent of my sins and open my he=
art to let Jesus come inside of me.  Jesus, you are my Lord and Savior.  I=
 believe you died for my sins and you were raised from the dead.  Fill me =
with your Holy Spirit.  Thank You Farther for saving me in Jesus name.  Am=
