        <font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"3">Now that we are in a bear market, =
it's time for bargain hunting.
        The StockDoubler is looking for companies that have dropped at lea=
st 80% from their yearly highs, reasoning
        that intelligent management will try to take advantage of depresse=
d prices.  We believe
        that National Institute Companies of America represents a great tu=
rnaround opportunity.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        NICM has just announced a buy back of up to 10% of their outstandi=
ng
        shares and this is very bullish for three reasons:</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p align=3D"left"><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"3">Management i=
s optimistic and believes that their stock is
            under priced.<br>

          <li>
            <p align=3D"left"><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"3">Corporate bu=
ying acts as a
            &quot;floor&quot; beneath the market, forcing new buyers      =
  to pay
            more.<br>
            </font></li>
          <li>
            <p align=3D"left"><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"3">NICM has the=
 excess cash available to buy their shares.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p align=3D"left"><font face=3D"Arial" size=3D"3">National Institu=
te Companies of America is a diversified financial holding company,
        working with banks and financial institutions in their marketing o=
f investments and
        insurance. We expect NICM's experienced Board of Directors to cont=
inue to be acquisition oriented
        to fuel their growth.<br>
        <br>
        The stock is very liquid, typically trading over half a million sh=
ares a day, and often has a
        narrow bid/ask spread of a penny or less.  We also expect a bounce=
 upward in price when
        they graduate to the OTCBB later this year.<br>
        <br>
        Our strategy: Buy NICM at prices up to .25, and sell half if it do=
ubles, holding the rest for
        long-term gains.
