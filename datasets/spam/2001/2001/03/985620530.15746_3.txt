===================================
WHY YOU NEED A DOT COM

1. Get a Better Name For Yourself
Whether you are a professional, a business or just someone who uses e-mail a
lot, you may find that your current e-mail address is too complicated or
simply too boring to remember. Recently, dot com registrars have allowed
ANYONE (businesses and consumers) to register dot com names up to 67
characters long. Because there can only be ONE unique dot com name in the
world, many people are rushing to reserve their names before its taken by
someone else. Some examples are:

- msmith@westcoastconsulting,com
- jenny@chan,com
- johnbrown@bestwestdesigns,com
- david@harpinder,com


 
2. Never Change Your E-Mail Address Again*
Having your own dot com name allows you to KEEP your identity on the
Internet. You will never have to change your e-mail address again once you
have your own dot com name. Your will be able to move your e-mail address
from one Internet provider to another because YOU OWN IT! Imagine the
headaches and friends you will save by not having to inform everyone each
time you change your e-mail address.


3. Thinking of a Web Site Later? Think Dot Com First!*
If you have considered building a web site sometime in the future, you
should reserve your dot com name today. Once you have your own dot com name,
you will be able to use it for a matching web site address
(www,YourName,com) later on.

*Note:  You will still require your ISP to host your email box.  A dot com
name ensures that you keep your email and web address no matter which ISP
you are with.
