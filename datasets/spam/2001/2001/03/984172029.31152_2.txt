   Have you ever wondered where the big groups come from??  Do they just sprout 
up over night?
Just a bunch of people grab some mics and BAMN!!  They are superstars.. NOT!!!!!
They ALL start as unsigned original indie bands, playing the clubs, starving, 
working two jobs just to pay the rent…dreaming about the day they get on the 
radio. Most are great bands even with CD’s out.. but no one gives them the chance 
to be heard.

what other bands around the world sound like???
