Announcing
Last night I sent an update out to my GPC and many in my downline have =
emailed me and asked me to share a portion of it with the Overall =
membership by posting it here.=20

I would like to share what I see happening with

Going Platinum over the next several months and the effect it will have =
on those who choose to share the vision.=20

Within a month, to a month and a half of the time the GPC launches, =
Going Platinum will issue the first commission checks which include GPC =
earnings. At that time tens of thousands of people will receive a check =
for doing things on the internet they have always done but=20

never before been paid for. There will be MANY, MANY people who will =
receive hundreds of dollars for their efforts. There will be MANY people =
who will receive a thousand dollars or more. There will be=20

dozens of people that will receive ten thousand dollars or more. And =
while you may find this totally impossible to believe, it will =
nevertheless be true. There will be a few people who will earn one =
hundred thousand dollars or more from the VERY FIRST MONTH the GPC is=20

in operation!!=20

Okay, so what if you don't believe me about the one hundred thousand =
part or for that matter even the ten thousand part. What do you think =
will happen when word instantly spreads around the internet and a=20

little latter through the neighborhoods of the world that tens of =
thousands of people world wide have just been paid tens or hundreds or =
even thousands of dollars just for using this brand new internet =
community Going Platinum and it is TOTALLY FREE to join and they get=20

FREE unlimited internet access to boot!! Well......what do you think?

I know what I see and I have absolutely no doubt that it will happen.

There is going to be the biggest gold rush in the history of mankind.

EVERYONE is going to want a piece of this action! I even envision the =
possibility of Going Platinum having to establish a waiting list for =
prospective new members as they continue to expand their global =
capabilities to handle the crush. Think that is far fetched?

Let me remind you what we have to offer. ANY internet user in over 200 =
countries throughout the world will have the ability to turn on their =
computer, get on the net, go to the Going Platinum portal and enroll for =
FREE and WITHIN MINUTES be earning a PROFIT for doing things they =
ALREADY ENJOY DOING on the internet!!! No investment other than time.=20

No special skills or training needed. No muss, no fuss. AND for many, =
they can also choose to TOTALLY ELIMINATE their monthly ISP bill which =
will be like immediately earning another $20-30 a month.=20

You tell me. Am I nuts!! Or might people be a little motivated to get in =
on this deal when the word quickly spreads about the tens of thousands =
of people who have just received a check from Going Platinum about 30-45 =
days after the launch of the GPC.

IT WILL BE THE GREATEST GOLD RUSH IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND!!!

Believe it folks. You don't seriously think that your brother or your =
neighbor or your co-worker is going to let you keep all that money for =
yourself do you! ;-)=20

There is going to be a surge of momentum that will make a tidal wave =
look like a ripple in the local pond. The question is ARE YOU GOING TO =
BE READY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT!!!

YOU ARE HERE NOW!! You have a TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE! You will have at =
least 3-6 months after launch with your track record of earnings to reap =
the rewards of your foresight before the whole world is able to set up =
shop.=20

It is time for you to set up your store. Millions of people are going to =
be looking for the maps, tools and equipment to get in on this gold =
rush. It's time for you to prepare for the crush. It's time for you to =
let people know that the trail to the richest gold strike in history =
LEADS RIGHT THROUGH YOU!!=20

I haven't pressed this issue much in past updates but it is time.=20

Going Platinum is MUCH MORE than an opportunity to add a little =
supplement to your income. Going Platinum CAN COMPLETELY CHANGE YOUR=20

FINANCIAL FUTURE!!=20

Each and every one of you will have the opportunity to build a FULL TIME =
INCOME within months after the GPC launches. If you have been reading =
your website and studied the articles I have written on understanding =
the GP compensation plan, you must be able to see that=20

if you put that plan together with the vision of the gold rush I have =
just shared with you, there is INCREDIBLE FINANCIAL POTENTIAL just =
ahead.=20

Will YOU be ready for it? Will YOU put in the effort to take advantage =
of it?=20

There is going to be a 3-6 month window of opportunity to change your =
life for the better that has NEVER been witnessed before and very =
likely, a window the likes of which will NEVER be open to you again.=20

This is YOUR CHANCE!! It is worthy of an all out effort. Three to six =
months of setting aside the TV, adjusting your schedule, being bolder =
and more confident than you have ever been before, and working like you =
have never worked before, can put you in a position to NEVER have to be =
concerned about money again. Three to six months of superior effort NOW =
can create a residual income that will pay you month after=20

month, year after year for the rest of your life even if you never do =
another thing with Going Platinum or ever go near a computer again.=20

In fact, even if you yourself were to move to a deserted island and =
never touched a computer again your income would probably INCREASE each =
month as the people you got started during this gold rush went out and =
built their own little nest eggs! Talk about a retirement plan!=20

"There's GOLD in them thar hills". STAKE YOUR CLAIM!!=20

Wishing you great success=20
