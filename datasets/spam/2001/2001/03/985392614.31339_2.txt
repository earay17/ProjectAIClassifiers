"I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, I took blood tes=
ts. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. After 8 weeks I took blood tes=
ts again. My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! Furthermo=
re, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! I definitely feel bett=
er overall and certainly have more energy. To say the least I am very impr=
essed and pleased with GH1. My "biological" age is now that of a 40 year o=
ld!" <BR>
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY <BR>
<BR>
"A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood pressure med=
ication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. After a year on the p=
roduct, my blood pressure is now 120/80--and I haven't been on the blood p=
ressure medication for months!" <BR>
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA <BR>
<BR>
"After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher level of ener=
gy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision were enhanced. My blo=
od pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and it seems every other day I=
 have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill at the gym. I've noticed a tig=
htening of the skin under my chin and a change in my lungs with much easie=
r breathing. After 4 months, I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One m=
orning, I had to do an extra karate workout just to expend all the extra e=
nergy!" "After 6 months on GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down t=
o 65! Also, my stamina has increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--=
this product is GREAT!" <BR>
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA <BR>
<BR>
"As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute and a =
half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where I could spri=
nt again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again after only 45 secon=
ds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!" <BR>
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno, CA <BR>
<BR>
"When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat & increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXE=
RCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches aro=
und my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--e=
ven though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision return=
ed. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print." <BR>
-Larry Baker, age 54, Oceanside, CA <BR>
<BR>
"I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. I have bee=
n under great stress in my business. I believe that taking Anti-Aging Form=
ula GH1 has had a big part in keeping my energy level up and having the st=
rength to stay positive in the midst of discouraging circumstances. Last w=
eek I came down with a cold. Colds are tough on me and seem to run their c=
ourse- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing th=
rough those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren'=
t as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. My muscles seem to =
have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy when I go o=
ut walking."<BR>
- Carolyn Munn <BR>
<BR>
"I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that =
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending $1,000 a month and need=
ed a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-A=
ging Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. Thank y=
ou Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"<BR>
-Rita Mills McCoy <BR>

"I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested,=
 in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my =
levels dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months =
on Anti-Aging Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, retur=
ning to its normal coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid me=
dication. All of this without having to change anything else about my life=
style, other than taking few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow!<=

<FONT color=3D"#00FFFF"> GH1 is the highest concentration of orally admini=
stered GH1 available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in intern=
ational units are usually prescribed to be taken as a  shot, two times per=
 day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 ha=

<FONT color=3D"#00FF00"><B><U> WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?</U></B></FONT>
<FONT size=3D3>
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"> <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which =
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the=
 endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemicall=
y similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first f=
ew hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormo=
nes secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throu=
ghout the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence.<BR>
<BR>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are new=
ly made. The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are con=
tinuously dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain =
their original cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously =
being produced to store memories of every new experience. Overall intellig=
ence and the ability to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth h=
ormone. Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age=
-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, de=
creased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, =
decreased mental function and loss of libido. When growth hormone falls be=
low normal levels, supplementation offers the all-natural potential for gr=
eat benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance which is safe and effe=
ctive with no known side effects, if taken in the proper dosage amounts.<B=
R>
<BR>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, test=
osterone, melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Ho=
rmones are tiny chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstre=
am in order to regulate the activities of the vital organs. The word "horm=
one" is derived from a Greek word meaning to stimulate. Many of these horm=
ones can be replaced to deter some of the effects of aging; however, GH re=
aches far beyond the scope of these other hormones. Not only does it preve=
nt biological aging, but it acts to greatly reverse a broad range of signs=
 and symptoms associated with aging, including making the skin more elasti=
c and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also helps restore hair color and =
hair loss.<BR>

<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"><B> THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3D3>
<FONT color=3D"#FF0000"> <BR>
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its pr=
oduction gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 f=
alls about 14% per decade, so that its production is reduced in half by ag=
e 60. While GH is not new, its availability as a supplement has been limit=
ed. Specialized clinics and physicians have been using GH for over 30 year=
s on thousands of patients with consistent results. <BR>
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only t=
he medical profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Ano=
ther problem has been that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino ac=
ids (protein), had been only effective administered through injections. Ho=
wever, a new technology developed by Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effe=
ctive, affordable and convenient alternative. <BR>
<BR>
GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61<BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tes=
ted to date. The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per d=
ecade. This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in=
 half by the age of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per=
 year at age 20, 200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of=
 age. Between the ages of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growt=
h hormone which results in SDS, or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. Thes=
e symptoms are part of the disease called aging which the medical communit=
y has determined is not a normal occurrence. Healing ability and energy le=
vels decrease, as does physical mobility. Those who want to maintain their=
 youthful vitality and stamina should include an effective growth hormone =
therapy as part of their health regimen.<BR>
