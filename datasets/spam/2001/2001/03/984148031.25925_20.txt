EXPLOSIVE STOCKS NEWSLETTER  
 
FOR FRIDAY, MARCH 9, 2001
 
CMEC (OTC-BB)
COMMERCIAL CONCEPTS INC.
TRADING IN THE .17 X .19 RANGE 
52 Week High spiked to $5.62
 
REVENUES STARTING TO FLOW IN as 
Major Rumors on Stock Message Boards of MORE News Releases to come.
 
 
The following  calculations come from CMEC'S latest news release and the Salt Lake
Tribune article.  With 12 schools with 2,680 screens and a downloadable
version to homes will double this to 5360 screens.  Take this 5360 and
you multiply that by
  $8.00 (From the SL Trib.) giving us $43,000 per month.  Now multiply
that by 5.3 (take 12 schools/63 school contracts =5.3) and we get
$227,000 per month and this is only for the schools they have announced
so far.
This means in millions of dollars to CMEC
What must be understood is that this is only Wavescreens without the
Medical Picture Base and X-Cards.
