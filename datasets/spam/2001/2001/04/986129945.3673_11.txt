********************************************************
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PART OF OUR AWARENESS PROGRAM 
AND BEING SENT TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS ONLY ONE TIME, 
THIS EMAIL ADDRESS WILL NOT RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE AGAIN. 
********************************************************

Kids Central Station provides effective identification 
through the use of our state-of-the-art identification  
products such as shoe tags, picture ID cards, bracelets, 
stickers, etc. There is no name or address on the 
products to compromise the child's identity.  Kids Central
Station is a Nationwide Notification Service linked to an 
Emergency Dispatch Center available 24-hours a day, 7 days
a week.

In an emergency situation we will call up to 12 contact 
phone numbers and a physician that were provided by the 
parents or guardian. Kids Central Station's rapid process 
of identification and availability of medical history of 
the patient minimizes the liability towards physicians and
hospitals.

Our membership has dramatically increased due to the "FREE 
LIFETIME" service available through the Internet, 
www.kidscentralstation.com.  It is inevitable that 911 
Personnel and Hospital Emergency Staff will encounter one 
of our members in an emergency situation. We are alerting 
the Public, Medical Personnel, Hospital Emergency Room 
Departments and all 911 related Services.

If you have any questions regarding our "Awareness Program,"  
or you are interested in becoming involved in starting a 
program in countries outside the United States, please visit 
our web site,  www.kidscentralstation.com or  contact us at 
1-800-KIDS-022 or fax 561-470-8250. Your cooperation will 
help make a difference.
