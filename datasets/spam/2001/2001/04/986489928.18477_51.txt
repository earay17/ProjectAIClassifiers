PTSIZE=3D10>Small Cap VISA Issuer stock Up 40% and Climbing<BR>
<BR>
Our top pick in the Small Cap growth sector, Junum, Inc. (OTC: JUNM <A HRE=
F=3D"http://www.junum.com">www.junum.com</A>) , announced a Web marketing =
alliance with Homestore.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOMS - <A HREF=3D"http://biz.ya=
hoo.com/n/h/homs.html">news</A>). The agreement exposes JUNUM to visitors =
of the Homestore.com(TM) family of Web sites, through targeted e-mail broa=
dcasts and other types of advertising within a co-branding environment. HO=
MS received over 8.4 million hits last month (Feb) on its real-estate buyi=
ng and rental related websites. We expect more good news from JUNM over th=
e next two weeks and expect the stock to approach the mid -to- high teens =
sometime in April. Junum CEO, David Coulter, is also featured on CEOcast (=
<A HREF=3D"http://www.ceocast.com">www.ceocast.com</A>) currently. Click o=
n the link to sign in and view the clip.<BR>
Junum is outperforming all original estimates and, based on its current fi=
nancial condition and projections, the Company is preparing an application=
 for listing on the American Stock Exchange. The Company has fulfilled all=
 conditions for AMEX listing, and anticipate this listing very soon.  Inve=
stors should see substantial gains in JUNM stock over the next several mon=
ths.<BR>
<BR>
INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS : Junum, Incorporated is a membership-based credit m=
anagement and financial services organization, utilizing the Internet and =
proprietary-technologies to redeem potentially credit-worthy, sub-prime co=
nsumers. The Company offers credit repair memberships to individual custom=
ers and small businesses, providing members the Company's own Junum.com VI=
SA card, Electronic Debt Negotiation services, Credit Profile Management, =
Identity Theft Notification, and a host of affiliated services designed to=
 aid members in establishing, redeeming and improving their credit. <BR>
<BR>
Through its established network of financial services partners and its pro=
gram of acquiring non-performing debt portfolios to be converted into Junu=
m.com VISA credit card and credit repair customers, analysts expect the Co=
mpany to grow its membership base to close to 200,000 by 2004.  Junum rece=
ntly completed the first of several planned acquisitions of non-performing=
 debt portfolios.  The purchased portfolio included approximately $400 mil=
lion of non-performing credit card debt profiles with over 180,000 potenti=
al Junum.com VISA credit card holders and credit repair/maintenance member=
s.  Junum will offer the holder in default a chance to reduce the amount o=
wed by reassuming a portion of their debt on a Junum.com VISA in combinati=
on with a monthly membership to Junum's leading edge credit repair and cre=
dit maintenance program.<BR>
We believe that Junum's unique customer-first business approach, its cost =
saving Internet and technology approach to credit management, and its esta=
blished network of partners in banking and credit, will enable the Company=
 to experience tremendous near-and-mid term revenue growth, and emerge as =
a significant player in the sub-prime credit marketplace. The emergence of=
 the Internet as a transaction platform will prove to be one of the most r=
ecognizable trends in financial services in the immediate term period. Wit=
h the emergence of online shopping and e-commerce, the demand and need for=
 credit cards is projected to increase significantly and Junum has focused=
 its business towards a highly lucrative, though often ignored, sub-prime =
sector of the consumer credit market.<BR>
<BR>
We believe that the Company represents an innovative approach to the sub-p=
rime consumer credit market, offering the best aspects of sub-prime credit=
 card companies and consumer credit organizations in a single, easy-to-use=
 Internet package. The Company anticipates significant membership growth a=
s a result of this unique market position; from roughly 22,545 members in =
2001 to 62,000 in 2002, and to approximately 176,000 members in 2004. <BR>
