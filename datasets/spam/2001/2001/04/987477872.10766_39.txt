A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Determine the 
Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Formulation Comprised of Botanically Derived 
Inhibitors of 5AR  in the Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia

Abstract

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is characterized by a receding hairline and/or 
hair loss within a given pattern on the scalp. The endocrinolgic processes 
associated with this disorder share a remarkable degree of similarity with 
those implicated in the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  AGA 
has also been shown to be responsive to drugs and agents used to treat BPH.  
Interestingly, certain botanical compounds have previously demonstrated 
efficacy against BPH.  Here we report the first example of a 
placebo-controlled, double-blind study undertaken in order to examine the 
benefit of these botanical substances in the treatment of AGA.  The results 
of this pilot study showed a highly positive response to treatment.  The 
blinded Investigative Staff Assessment reported that 60% (6/10) study 
subjects dosed with the active study formulation were rated as improved at 
the final visit.  This proof of concept study demonstrated the safety and 
efficacy of these botanical substances against AGA, and justifies the 
expansion to larger trials.
