Attention:  Internet Domain Registrant

The new top level domain names with extensions .BIZ, .INFO, .PRO,

and will be released soon, but don't wait until then to register.  
These domains are available NOW for pre-registration at:

the new suffixes -.info, .biz, and .pro -likely to become available
later this year..."
