Hi,

I don't normally send out virus warnings, but this one  is
apparently one of the latest infections running rampant on 
the 'Net.

If you use an email client and you receive an email that says
"Take a look at the attachment" - delete it immediately.  Do not
"take a look"!

The email is infected with a "worm" called "TROJ_BADTRANS.A"
and if you click on the attachment, you'll get the worm.  The
worm replies to all unread email messages with itself attached
to the email. This email has the same subject header and
message body as the original email. The name of the sender is
the name of the user who is currently logged on to the
infected computer.

The worm is only a few days old, and some of you have probably
gotten it from other sources and are now wondering what the
heck to do about it. 

Here is the cure: 

(1)  Go to: http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/ and click on the
TROJ BADTRANS.A (should be listed as number 8 in the Top 10
list).

(2)  Follow the directions under "Solution".  We found that
Steps 4 and 5 were not necessary, but you might need them, so
follow them if you can.

(3)  Even if you have a good anti-virus software, the scan at
this site:
http://housecall.antivirus.com/housecall/start_corp.asp
is the best we've found, as it uncovered kak worm files that
were dormant and overlooked by both McAfee and Norton.  Click
that link, then select your Country and click Go, wait a
minute or two depending on your connection speed, and a window
will pop up asking if you want to download their Trend Micro
scanner.  Click Yes.

(4)  A small window will pop up that says "Active Update" and
indicates that the file is downloading.  This can take 1-10
minutes depending on your connection speed.

(5)  When the file has downloaded, you'll see the screen that
looks like your directory listing, with "My Computer" and the
names of your drives.  Put a checkmark next to the drives you
want to scan and click the gray SCAN button.  You'll see it
scanning your files, which will take 1-10 minutes depending on
the number of files in the drives you selected.

(6)  If you have infected files on your computer, look at the
"Scan Result" column of the screen.  If it says "Non
Cleanable" then you can just delete the file.  If it says
"Cleanable" then click on the Clean button when the scan is
finished.

That's it!  Thankfully, this worm is low-risk and does not
corrupt data or programs residing on your hard drive.  It's
just extremely annoying and it propagates with lightening
speed.  If you're not sure you've been infected, you should do
the scan anyway just to be sure.

To be completely safe, you should never click on an email
attachment from anyone unless you know for sure what the 
attached file contains.  Even your best friend can
unknowingly send you a virus!

If you have questions about the steps covered in this email, 
you will likely find the answer if you study the antivirus.com 
web site (see above).  Their Virus Information Center 
(top left tab on their site) is an extensive resource.

To your computer's health!
