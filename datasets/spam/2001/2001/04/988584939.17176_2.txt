PRESS RELEASE!           

OUR LATEST & GREATEST - JUST RELEASED!  

       "Millions" Volume-16" /// Address List on CD
 
Over 12 MILLION of the VERY BEST e-mail addresses available!!

The "Millions" Volume-16 Address List CD, is the ABSOLUTE BEST
e-mail address list available anywhere today.  

We've even outdone ourselves with this volume.

The "Millions" Volume-16 E-Mail Address List CD is comprised of
over 12 MILLION PREMIUM & SUPER clean email addresses - you can
start mailing as soon as you receive the CD! Each file contains
up to 20,000 email addresses.  All addresses sorted by Internet
domain (they cannot be sorted by any other criteria).

NO "duplicate" addresses. ALL "dupes" filtered out.

HERE'S HOW WE GET THE CLEANEST E-MAIL
ADDRESSES AVAILABLE ANYWHERE!!

1.  200+ million lines of e-mail addresses were filtered and
duplicates eliminated. 

2.  A filter list of 400+ words/phrases reduced the lists even
more.  No addresses with profane or inappropriate wording
survived.

3.  A special filter was used to eliminate most of the "web
poisoned" e-mail addresses from our lists.  Our EXCLUSIVE system
reduced these "bogus" addresses to zero.

4.  Next we used an exclusive database of anti-internet
advertising extremists to clean our lists of every
hacker/terrorist we could identify.

5.  In addition, we maintain an updated database of those who
have asked to be removed from our mailing lists.

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS . . . .

 . . our lists are thoroughly cleaned & free of all the "bogus"
addresses used by some to add inflated numbers to their lists. We
perform hundreds of hours in production and spend thousands on
the latest software in order to offer you the cleanest and PUREST
list of quality e-mail addresses to be found ANYWHERE!

Your "Millions" Volume-16 E-Mail Address List WILL RESULT IN:

Higher response ratios
Higher sales ratios
More receptive prospects; less flames & non-buyers

 
We don't compromise quality, that's why we always say...

"You can buy the all of the REST or you can buy the BEST"!

THE MILLIONS CD  - Vol-16  IS THE BEST!
