Evidence Eliminator is set to double in price during 
May...........
Get it now before the price rise!

Did you know for example that every click you make on Windows 98 
Start Menu 
is logged and stored permanently on a hidden encrypted database 
within your own computer?
Do you want your family or the authorities to find out what sites 
you surfed?
Did you download any "warez" or MP3 lately? 
Did you access barely legal or illegal web sites by mistake?
Did someone load a console or a banner on your browser with 
illegal material?

Remember, you are NEVER safe!!!

Anyone who surfs the web, newsgroups, participates in webchat or 
IRC is "caching" images on their PC without even knowing it. 

Ever seen the stories on the news or in the paper where a PC 
owner takes their PC in for repair and gets busted for illegal 
images on their PC?  Many didnt even know they were there. While 
they do eventually get released and charges dropped, the 
embarrasment is unbelievable.

Dont fall vicitm to such a thing. KNOW whats on your PC at all 
times and KNOW your hard drive is "clean" visit 
http://www.virtue.nu/ee2001/ for more information on how to 
accomplish this.

Thankyou,
