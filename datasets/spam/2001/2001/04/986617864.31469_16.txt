   GOLFERS...    How would you like to own a golf course?

Now you can.

 One of Golf Digests "Americas 500 Best Places To Play Golf" and one of the most 

beautiful and scenic golf course around the country. Can be yours for just a 25 word 

essay.

Not only can you win a golf course but you have a terrific chance to win a New 2001

Ford F150 Pickup or a new Ranger pickup, or how about a 2001 Ford Focus 4 door sedan.

Chance of winning are really great, about one in 34,000.  Pretty good compared to the 

multi state lottery  with odds of 1 in 80 million.
