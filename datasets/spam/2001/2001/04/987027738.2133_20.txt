Not only do you get FREE isp - you can check here to see if there is a =
local # for you (this is the company providing the isp for GP - =
http://www.uu.net/us/network/pops/

=20

You can cancel your reg ISP next month and save yourself $$ right away - =
but ......... that's not the best part..........

=20

You get PAID $$ for being online!  Yes - just for being online! =20

=20

Just imagine if you could get into AOL - YAHOO - etc etc before they =
launched??? How many shares would you buy?

=20

This company is going to be HUGE HUGE HUGE - they are planning on taking =
over! =20

=20

This is basically how it works! =20

=20

They give you FREE isp and pay you to be online!  That way you are using =
their portal for all/most of your internet use!  And perhaps you didn't =
know this  - but EVERYTHING  you do while your on the internet is making =
someone else $$!  This company is giving you a % back of what they make =
from your use!  Therefore - they are making $$ and giving you $$ back.  =
They are still making more $$ then you - that's how they can afford to =
it.

=20

Every ad you see - every page you go to - every email you send someone - =
everything - someone is getting paid - why not get paid back????????

=20

It is FREE to join so you have nothing to lose!  However, if you do sign =
up for your paid membership now $25 - before the launch date of April =
15th you will earn yourself a founding member status.  What does this =
mean?  This means that you will own a share in the company!  When they =
start doing their global campaign next week - there will be hundreds of =
thousands and more signing up at the corporate site!  They will be =
sharing those signups with their founding members and placing them under =
you!
