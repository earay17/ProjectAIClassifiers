Did you know.........

For example that every click you make on Windows 98 Start Menu 
is logged and stored for ever on a hidden encrypted database 
within your own computer?
your PC is keeping frightening records of both your online and 
off-line activity.

Pretty frightening.....Check out the facts for yourself at.....  
http://www.evidence-eliminator.com/go.shtml?A657156

Your family or the authorities could find out what sites you 
surfed?
Have you accessed barely legal or illegal web sites by mistake?
Has someone loaded a console or a banner on your browser with 
illegal material?
 
Remember, you are NEVER safe!!!

I was shocked at what I found.
Files I shredded months earlier were clearly visible using this 
software.

It is proven to defeat the exact same forensic software as used 
by the US Secret Service, 
Customs Department and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD),and 
is completely legal.



 
You really do need.............Evidence Eliminator.
