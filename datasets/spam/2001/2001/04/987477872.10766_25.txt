CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR BSII !!!

This Thursday BSII will be profiled by some major newsletters. There will 
be huge volume and a strong increase in price for several days. These are 
the same newsletters that profiled SRHN two weeks ago. They brought SRHN 
from $0.17 to $ .81 in ten days. We know for certain that the same groups 
are going to profile BSII starting on Thursday.


We are very proud that we can share this information with you so that you 
can make a profit out of it. It is highly advisable to take a position in 
BSII as soon as possible, today before the market closes or tomorrow.


The stock is trading near its 52-week low and will start moving up 
immediately. We think the stock could easily reach $3 in less than a month.

Good luck and watch BSII fly this week!
