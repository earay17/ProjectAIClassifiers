Dear Bruce,

My name is John Barister and I work for a company called Electronic
Traffic Management. Our Company has done a large amount of market research
that has brought back some very interesting results.  

We suspect that you're not getting the return on investment you were
hoping for with your website. If you would like, I would be happy to give
you some tools that will start to bring in larger returns.

You can go to our website and download the free video on how to get more
business from your online investment. If you keep doing what you've been
doing, you will keep getting what you've been getting! Just visit the link
below and follow the instructions:
