	The Top 10 Steps to Set and Achieve 
		Your Goals - Every Time!


 It's been said that everyone has goals, whether we know it or
not.  We have goals to keep our current job, or to get a
different one.  We have goals to save for the future, or to
travel, take a vacation, or purchase the things we need and want
to make our lives more enjoyable.  An important distinction,
however, is that top achievers are very intentional and focused
on their goals, while many of the rest of us are not. 

Top achievers know that the wording, structure, timing and
format of a goal can make it's achievement much easier – or far
more difficult.  Top achievers understand the basic skills for
setting and reaching their goals, every time!  They know how to
design goals that create success.  Here are the 10 most
important steps to set and achieve your goals: 

1.  Reachable goals are SPECIFIC.  Top achievers know that to
reach their goals, the brain must know exactly, precisely, what
they are trying to accomplish.  Never word a goal with vague
terms like "some" or "a little bit", or "more".  Be specific! 
If you want to lose 8 pounds and reach a weight of 175, specify
those exact numbers.  If you want to save $200 this month, be
exact.  Your brain can help you accomplish almost anything if it
knows precisely what you are aiming for. 

2.  Reachable goals are SIMPLE.  Many people describe their
goals in complex terms of retiring on the beach in Hawaii, with
nice cars and lots of money, and….  Their list goes on and on. 
Any ONE of those things is a great goal, but the combination
becomes over whelming and the brain gets confused.  If you want
to retire in Hawaii, just say so!  If you want to increase your
sales by 10% this month, say so!  Keep your goals simple, clear,
and focused. 

3.  Reachable goals are SIGNIFICANT.  No one can muster the
enthusiasm, hard work and courage to reach a goal they don't
really care about.  A reachable goal is one you really, really,
REALLY want!  It's something that will change your life, enhance
your health or wealth, and make you proud.  It gets your juices
flowing, gets you up in the morning, and keeps you going all day
long, because it is important!  Set goals that are worth
achieving! 

4.  Reachable goals are STRATEGIC.  High achievers know that
the best goals accomplish many great outcomes, all at one time. 
Running a 10K race will almost certainly:  1) feel great!  2)
help you lose weight.  3) lower your cholesterol level  4)
strengthen your heart 5) and lower you risk of heart disease  6)
increase your energy and stamina, and 7) improve your outlook. 
Design your goals to strategically impact as many areas of your
life as possible.  You'll have more reasons to reach your goal
and more excitement when you do! 

5.  Reachable goals are MEASURABLE.  A goal without a
measurable outcome is just a pipe-dream.  You can't achieve a
pound of "happiness" or 6 inches of "self-esteem", but you CAN
get a new job.  You CAN run a mile in under 7 minutes, or do 100
sit-ups.  Someone has wisely observed that, "What gets measured,
gets done."  Define your goals in terms of height, weight,
dollars, inches, or hours.  Then measure your progress until you
achieve your desired outcome. 

6.  Reachable goals are RATIONAL.  To reach your goal, you will
need a plan, a path, and a vehicle for getting there.  Your
goals must make sense!  When you explain them to friends and
family, your goals should create excitement, draw support, and
encouragement.  Your goals should be just out of reach, but not
out of sight!  You want to stretch to be your best, not strain
after impossible dreams.  Set goals you CAN and WILL achieve! 

7.  Reachable goals are TANGIBLE.  Choose goals that you can
see, hear, smell or touch.  Go for things you will enjoy and
that you can clearly visualize.  The brain has  hard time going
for "financial security", but it can visualize a bank statement
with nice, large numbers on it!  Define your goals in terms that
excite the senses, then go for it with all your heart! 

8.  Reachable goals are WRITTEN.  High achievers always know
precisely what they want, because they've written it down. 
Often, they write a short description of their goals every
single morning, as a personal reminder of their priorities and
their objectives.  The act of writing your goals down vastly
increases your chance of success.  Write it down!  Then, keep
your notes where you can see and read them every day. 

9.  Reachable goals are SHARED.  We are far more likely to
stick to our plan and reach our goals if we know our friends and
family support us.  Being part of a team increases our
determination, our stamina, and our courage.  Caution:  Never
share your goals with anyone who may ridicule, tease or
discourage you!  The world is full of doubters and you have no
time for them.  But, find a support team, a group of
cheerleaders, and a coach who will encourage you every step of
the way.  High achievers count on and work with other winners! 

10.  Reachable goals are CONSISTENT WITH YOUR VALUES.  One of
the biggest reasons people fail to achieve their goals is that
they have conflict between their behavior and their values. 
However, when your values and your goals are in agreement, there
is no stopping you!  Clarify your values first, then set simple,
specific, measurable, tangible, written goals that are
consistent with those values.  You will achieve them, every
single time!
