 Dear Friend,<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
Let me ask you a very straightforward question and before you answer, <BR>=
<BR>
think about it for a moment.  When you have trouble making ends meet<BR><B=
R>
on today's income, how do you expect to retire and live on less money<BR><=
BR>
than you earn now? Read the question again before you go on - it is a<BR><=
BR>
very serious question.  If your income stopped today, how many months<BR><=
BR>
could you survive in your current lifestyle with no money coming in?<BR><B=
R>
What will be different in your life two years from now if you continue<BR>=
<BR>
doing what you are doing now?<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security <BR><BR>
comes from employment.  Yet we hope we never become the <BR><BR>
victims of downsizing, career burn out, illness or injury.  The <BR><BR>
frightening reality for most people is the plastic in their wallets<BR><BR=
>
determines the quality of their lives.<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<B>Ask yourself, are you.....<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<I>* Tired of working for someone else and getting paid what <BR><BR>
     THEY tell you you're worth?<BR><BR>

* Tired of the get rich quick on $5 fantasy programs?<BR><BR>
* Tired of the Multi Level marketing residual income illusion?<BR><BR>
* Looking for REAL wealth?</I><BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
THEN LOOK AT THIS!!!<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
* <I>Free enterprise in its purest form, not Multi Level marketing or fran=
chise.<BR><BR>
* Proven lead generation system brings qualified prospects to you.<BR><BR>
