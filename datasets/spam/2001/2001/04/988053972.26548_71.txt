the same newsletters that profiled PKTR two weeks ago. They brought PKTR 
from $1.87 to $7.82 in ten days. We know for certain that the same groups 
are going to profile BSII starting on Wednesday.

We are very proud that we can share this information with you so that you 
can make a profit out of it. It is highly advisable to take a position in

The stock is trading near its 52-week low and will start moving up 
immediately. We think the stock could easily reach $3 in less than a month.


Good luck and watch BSII fly this week!
