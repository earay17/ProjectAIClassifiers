Anyone who surfs the web, newsgroups, participates in webchat or 
IRC is "caching" images on their PC without even knowing it. Ever 
seen the stories on the news or in the paper where a PC owner 
takes their PC in for work and gets busted for illegal images on 
their PC?  Many didnt even know they were there. While they do 
eventually get released and charges dropped, the embarrasment is 
unbelievable.

Dont fall vicitm to such a thing. KNOW whats on your PC at all 
times and KNOW your hard drive is "clean" visit 
http://www.virtue.nu/ee2001/ for more information on how to 
accomplish this.
 
Did you know for example that every click you make on Windows 98 
Start Menu 
is logged and stored permanently on a hidden encrypted database 
within your own computer?
Do you want your family or the authorities to find out what sites 
you surfed?
Did you download any "warez" or MP3 lately? 
Did you access barely legal or illegal web sites by mistake?
Did someone load a console or a banner on your browser with 
illegal material?

Remember, you are NEVER safe!!!
