HUNZA DIET BREAD is said to beat all fad diets hands down. 
It's the fastest, healthiest, easiest & no discomfort way to lose weight...RAPIDLY !!

IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN FIGHTING A CONSTANT BATTLE AGAINST INCREASING WEIGHT ...
..This is the most exciting news you will EVER hear !!

By Barry Jamison,
Special feature writer
=============================================================

Here is a message to all you genius research scientists trying to find a painless way 
for people to lose weight.   It's been done! Not by a scientist, but,..... by a housewife.

Being hailed here as the NATURAL weight loss method of the century, HUNZA DIET BREAD 
is rolling out like a juggernaught!

THIS IS NOT some phoney story ...  it is 100% REAL AND GENUINE FOLKS.. !!

IF YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE MIRACLE FOR LOSING WEIGHT WITH NO HUNGER, 
NO LOSS OF NUTRITION .... then read on...!!

Like most great inventions & breakthroughs in medicine & discoveries of the past,
The bread was discovered by accident. Lotte Svenson, wife of a Swedish health researcher, 
was trying to duplicate a 2,000-year-old, high roughage bread used by the little known 
civilization of Hunza. The Hunzas were being studied by her husband.

The Hunzas are considered to be the healthiest people on earth.Their bread is the main part 
of their diet. Lotte was trying to make this bread good tasting so that her children would 
eat it and benefit healthwise.

She succeeded in coming up with a recipe that was absolutely delicious. Everybody loved it. 
But, then a startling discovery was made. Just one or two very small pieces of bread would 
ruin a person's appetite for 5 or 6 hours!

At first, she became upset at this drawback. But then while talking it over with her 
husband, Lars, it hit them.... This was not a drawback at all, but a huge benefit!! It was 
the ultimate weapon in the fight against obesity that researchers have been trying to 
discover for decades.

Lotte had apparently come up with the first natural and healthy appetite inhibitor... Or 
was she the first? Could this be a designed bread invented thousands of years ago?

Mr. Svenson is a researcher for a private Swedish Health Institute. He had been studying 
the Hunzas for years. Now he had some questions that needed answers. 

The Hunzas have little food in the winter. Was the bread an ancient discovery of a hunger 
suppressant which also provided healthful nourishment to the body during winter months?

The Svensons attribute the powerful appetite inhibiting properties of the bread as such ...

." Theory 1 is that Lotte, while experimenting with the bread recipe accidentally combined
natural food substances which react together to form a natural appetite or hunger inhibitor.

There are also facts being uncovered that support Theory 2 that this bread was designed in 
ancient times for the express purpose of tiding people over, when food supplies were scarce. 

Let's start with the Hunzas who are the healthiest people on earth. I consider their bread 
to be one of the main reasons for this."

"The Hunzas exist isolated from the rest of the world in the Himalayan Mountains where they 
live to be 110 to 120 years old. They have no cancer, heart attacks, or other major 
disorders to speak of. They are active and fit to the very end. 

Men father children at 100 years and older. Overweight people are unheard of because they 
have the perfect weight control system."

Visitors to Hunza all came back with the same description of the Hunza people:

"Hunza men are straight, tall, broad-shouldered,deep-chested, slim-waisted, heavy-legged, 
and have full heads of hair. Hunza women are straight, tall, slim-waisted, developed bosoms, 
perfect complexions, and luxuriant hair. Both men and women have perfect teeth and eyesight 
even at 100 years and older! They are neat, clean, intelligent and friendly. 
And you can't find an overweight person.

Hunza women at 80 look no older than North American/European women of late 50's. Fatigue is 
virtually unknown. Hunza men over 90 years old repeatedly walk the mountain trail of 65 
miles from the town of Gilgit with a full pack and immediately start to work in the fields 
again!"

An eye-opening experiment was conducted by the world renowned, brilliant English surgeon, 
Dr. Robert McCarrison, who tested the merits of the Hunza diet in a controlled, scientific 
experiment on 5,000 laboratory rats.

He took the one group of normal rats and put them on the Hunza diet.  He then took a second 
group and put them on a typical English diet.

After a period the rats on the Hunza diet showed absolutely no disease, had proper weight, 
and were completely healthy beyond normal.

The rats on the English diet were overweight, diseased and had tumors, ulcers, bad teeth, 
crooked spines, falling hair, skin disorders, heart trouble, kidney trouble, glandular 
trouble and they were very hostile. He then took these diseased rats who had been on the 
English diet and put them on the Hunza diet.     They all became well!

I also noticed that the Svenson's were exceptionally trim, fit and healthy. Our interview 
took place in the kitchen with the HUNZA DIET BREAD being prepared for me to taste.

"O.K., now we can continue. So, you feel that the Hunza bread may be "by design" both a 
hunger suppressant and a super health food?"

Answer:  "Yes, but if it is, there's a question, who designed it? Now the Hunzas were 
originally soldiers of Alexander the Great. This bread may have been designed for the use 
of his far traveling armies. It would make sense. It's the most compact form of hunger 
satisfaction and nutrition I know of.

But, further investigation brought about some really wild possibilities. According to 
traces of Macedonian Heritage, this bread could have originated in Egypt over 5,000 years 
ago. As you know, the Egyptians were capable of doing many things that modern science still 
cannot duplicate.

BUT GETTING BACK TO THE FOCAL POINT OF THIS MATTER, REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT CAME FROM, WE 
HAVE IT. AND, IT'S TESTED AND IT WORKS."

Question: "That bread smells delicious. And since we're going to discuss the bread, let's 
ask the discoverer, Lotte, how did it all start?"

Answer:  "Well, as I mentioned. Lars had been investigating the Hunzas for many years and 
was convinced that their bread was one of the major reasons for their good health. So he 
asked me to see if I could duplicate it and use it at home.

I thought it would be easy at first but it turned into a nightmare.The recipes that 
visitors to Hunza came back with were either too general or did not turn into bread at all. 
So, I decided to make a list of all the key food elements in Hunza and began experimenting, 
trying to come up with a bread that would taste good so that our kids would like it too."

Question: "How long did it take before you were successful?"

Answer:  "Oh, after about six months of trial and error I finally hit on a perfect batch 
one summer morning. Everyone in the family shared some of the bread and raved about how 
good it was.

With no exaggeration, it was the best bread we had ever tasted. After eating the bread, 
nobody had an appetite that day and the kids weren't hungry for lunch which was very 
unusual but we didn't think much about it at the time.

Then we started to notice that whenever we ate the bread during the day we weren't hungry 
for our evening meal. It got so that I wouldn't allow anyone to eat the bread unless it 
was with our evening meal.  

But, then I found that when I served it at dinner, everybody ate a much smaller amount of 
their meal.

It got to the point that if we were going out to eat or if I was cooking a special dinner, 
the bread was not allowed for that day. I was even beginning to get upset that my delicious 
bread had turned into a problem because it devoured everyone's appetite and hunger."

Question: "How long did it take you to realize that what you really had was the all-time 
weapon against obesity?"

Answer:  "You know it was quite a long time. Three or four months. And surprisingly, my 
husband was involved in obesity research at the time. Also, both of us had trouble with 
being overweight.

There it was right in front of our noses; but, we were too close to it, to see it ourselves. Then 
one day we were talking to a friend I grew up with who was telling us that she was taking 
prescription diet pills to help reduce her appetite.

It hit both of us at once. We jumped up and said. "Boy, have we got the thing for you!" 
That was it.

We both were ready to kick ourselves for not seeing it before.

Both my husband and I started using the bread as a weight loss device and began losing 
weight like crazy, much faster than any weight loss method we ever tried, and, we have 
tried them all believe me. We then decided to call it HUNZA DIET BREAD."

Now, I like hearing about a diet that's been around for at least 2,000 years. That rings of 
stability. (At this point Lotte placed the hot bread on a bread board. It looked very 
appetizing to say the least.) Tell me about the advantages of HUNZA DIET BREAD.
I will get a piece, won't I?"

Answer:  "Of course, just as soon as it cools a little. There are primary and secondary 
benefits. The biggest benefit I can think of is that the dieter just doesn't suffer AT ALL! 
It's such a natural and powerful appetite inhibitor.

This bread satisfies both appetite and hunger. And it does it with only 84 calories 
(100 calories spread with butter) as effectively as most 1800 calorie full meals.

We define appetite and hunger like this: appetite is mainly the desire you get for food 
even when you know you're really not hungry.  It's that craving in your mouth you get 
that's known as the cold mouth feeling.

It can also be present even though you've just eaten. Your stomach may be full but you 
still crave something else. This is the feeling you get with a protein diet. You can stuff 
yourself with protein until you're ready to bust but the cold mouth craving is still there.

Hunger on the other hand is best described as those pangs of hunger you get or that empty 
feeling in your stomach that lets you know you really need to eat something rather than 
simply wanting to eat for the enjoyment of it.

After a piece or two of HUNZA DIET BREAD you eliminate both appetite and hunger. You feel 
satisfied and full. And, it lasts depending on the person up to 7 hours. For both of us it 
lasts 6 to 7 hours."

Question: "What is the secondary benefit?"

Answer:  "Well, first of all each piece of HUNZA DIET BREAD is close to being a balanced 
meal in itself. So right off the bat you don't strip your body of nutrition or give it 
too much of one thing or too little of another.

Second, not only is the bread nutritional, but it contains some proven good health 
producing foods of the Hunzas. Also, it is high in roughage or fiber. It passes through 
your digestive system quickly so the actual absorbed calories are less. 
You also become very regular eating this bread."

Question: "Lotte, tell me what it's like to eat a piece of the bread, that is, what do you 
experience yourself?"

Answer:  "OK., let's start with the eating. We suggest eating it while it's still warm, 
with a little butter. It's a heavy bread. I only need one piece, my husband usually has 
2 pieces.  Eating it is the first delightful experience you'll have. It tastes better than 
any bread that we've ever eaten. Along with the taste, being warm makes it truly 
satisfying to eat.

Now, here's what its like hour by hour after you eat the bread.

Hour 1 and 2.  Each minute after you finish eating the bread seems like a build-up of a 
"fullness" feeling. It's just as though you have kept on eating. You keep getting fuller 
and fuller. Both your appetite and hunger are very satisfied. You don't crave anything more.

Hour 3.  In hour 3 something else happens. The thought of food just doesn't appeal to you. 
It's not an unpleasant experience, quite the opposite. But, you don't have a desire for 
food in any way, shape or form.

Hour 4 and 5.  You no longer have a feeling of being stuffed or turned off by the thought 
of eating but, there's a kind of nothing feeling. You don't want to eat, and you don't 
crave anything. It's just as I said, a sort of comfortable "nothing" stage.

Hour 6 and 7.  Toward the end of the 6th hour you begin to get mildly hungry which then 
slowly increases into the 6th and 7th hour."

Question: "Now, all that for only the cost of 100 to 200 calories. You can't get that 
performance out of a 2,000 calorie meal can you?"

Answer:  "Right. Now you've got the gist of thewhole thing.

Here's another little known thing about standard lunch hours and dinners. Let's say you 
eat a milkshake, hamburger and french fries for lunch, that's over a 1,000 calories. 
There's a lot of sugar and salt in that meal.

When you're done the first thing that happens is that your body shoots a large amount of 
insulin into your system to counteract the sugar. Your blood sugar is lowered and within 
an hour you feel hungry again and start snacking. On top of that the salt has made you 
thirsty and you gulp water or soft drinks and retain the fluids with all that 
salt(sodium) in foods.

On the other hand, if you try a "Weight watchers" lunch, or similar balanced diet, you'd 
have to eat between 400 to 600 calories of cottage cheese, lean meat, and eggs to feel 
reasonably full. But,you would not be satisfied and almost immediately you'd be hungry 
again and need to consume more of the same.

You can't win. There's never been a diet before that exists where you don't suffer in 
some way."

Question: "Lars, exactly what kind of a program do you go on to lose weight with 
HUNZA DIET BREAD?"

Answer:  "There are many ways to do it. This is another benefit. It's flexible. Here are 
some typical suggestions. Each piece of bread is thinly spread with butter for a total 
of 100 calories.

Plan A:  Eat 1 piece every 5 hours of the 16 hours you're awake. That's 3 pieces which
total 300 calories. This is the fastest way to lose weight I know of. It works faster 
for me than any high protein diet.

Why? You have more energy and burn more calories. Second, the high fiber bread keeps 
your digestive system regular. Third, your body stays healthy. A healthy body means a 
properly functioning metabolic system.

Plan B:  Really gorge yourself with the bread. Two pieces every four hours for a total 
of 8 pieces but only 800 calories. You'll feel full all day. In fact, I doubt many people 
could eat this much of the bread.

Plan C:  Eat a piece in the morning for breakfast and a piece 3 hours before your dinner 
and you will eat a great deal less.

Plan D:  Eat a piece of HUNZA DIET BREAD, 10 minutes before you eat your regular meal. 
When we do this we eat only a fraction, such as 1/4 of what we would normally eat. If we 
wait longer than 10 minutes we don't want to eat at all.

Plan E:  Eat the bread at the end of meals that don't fill you up enough, such as low 
calorie meals. This is a perfect way to use the bread. You eat a low calorie meal, enjoy 
it, then eat a piece or two of bread to fill you up. Perfect! No suffering and no urge 
to snack.

Plan F: Alternate Plan A, B, C, D. We recommend an alternation of the plans, but some 
people who just want to get the weight off as soon as possible will use Plan A exclusively."


Comment:  "Yes, you can really think up all kindsof ways to use the bread. For instance, 
as a housewife it's harder to diet because you have to prepare food for the family. I eat 
my bread exactly 2 hours before I am going to prepare a meal. That way when I prepare the 
meal I am in the 3rd hour where food just doesn't hold any interest for me. No way am 
I tempted to nibble or taste."

Question: " you all look very healthy. Is it because of the bread?"

Answer:   "That's a big part of it. You feel better and look better after you start 
eating this bread. You know my daughter, besides having a weight problem, also had a mild 
case of acne, and since she started eating the bread her skin has completely cleared up."

Question: "Lars, how many pounds can you lose a week using this bread?"

Answer:   "The exact number of pounds depends on the person's size and metabolic rate. 
Using the bread I lost 11 pounds and Lotte lost 7 pounds in the first two weeks.

The point is, as I said earlier, that our experience shows that you lose weight faster on 
this method than any other method that I know exists."
.... AND YOU DO NOT SUFFER .....

YOU WILL LOSE AT LEAST 1 DRESS/ OR CLOTHES SIZE IN 10 DAYS.

Question: "That's a lot of weight to lose in such a short period of time. Lotte, I see 
you're cutting the bread. It's strange to say, it even looks like it would fill you up 
quickly."

Answer: "You'll soon see for yourself. Take a piece. Spread a little butter on it and enjoy.

I had a piece with butter. The bread was medium brown and it was a heavy bread. It had a 
very appealing grainy texture and when I spread the butter on the warm piece it melted 
into the bread and made my mouth water.

I took a bite. The delicious taste of the bread filled my mouth. You could tell that it 
was hearty, full of substance, chewy, and I could just tell it was good for you. Perhaps 
our bodies trigger an instinct that lets us know what's good or bad for us.

White bread gives you an empty feeling like you're biting into cotton compared to this 
bread. It was indeed the best bread I ever tasted. I devoured two pieces and felt very 
full and satisfied. I looked at the time. It was 1:25 pm."

Question: "You weren't kidding were you? That bread is out of this world. It just gives 
you what you crave. I can't put my finger on it."

Answer:  "The best part is yet to come. Let me know what you experience by calling us in 
about 6 hours."

Question: "I'll tell you my appetite is just about gone right now. I see what you mean 
by the build up effect. I feel like I have just eaten a full 3 course meal. "

THIS IS HOW  EVERYONE WORLDWIDE CAN GET THE BREAD: ..........

We originally felt the best way to make the bread available to the public was to contract 
with a reputable food processor to prepare and package the bread and then distribute it 
for us.  But that turned out to be unbelievably expensive and the red tape involved in 
getting a food product on the market wasn't something we wanted to get involved with.

SO WE DECIDED TO JUST PUBLISH THE RECIPE FOR EVERYONE WHO'D LIKE TO 
MAKE IT AT HOME...THIS WAY EVERYONE CAN AFFORD IT.

To order a copy, all you have to do is write "HUNZA DIET BREAD" on a piece of paper, 
include your NAME and EMAIL ADDRESS and send it along with CASH ONLY of USD$20.

SORRY, NO MONEY ORDERS OR CHECKS...CASH ONLY USD$20 .... We are in Sweden & the cost
of cashing USD checks & money orders are prohibitive - not to mention it takes around
30 days to get them processed - SO, SORRY AGAIN, BUT CASH ONLY ! USD$20

MAKE SURE THE $20 CASH IS SECURELY WRAPPED IN THE LETTER FOR SECURITY.
USE 2 SHEETS OF PAPER & A BROWN COLORED BUSINESS SIZE ENVELOPE.
(9.5 inch x 4.75 inch approx)

WE WOULD MUCH PREFER TO EMAIL THE ORDERS BACK as it is MUCH LESS WORK FOR US....but
If you want it printed and posted back to you - include your postal address ...PLUS...
you must include an EXTRA $10 for postage, stationary (envelope) printing & HANDLING. 
This is very time consuming for us .... therefore the extra $10 cost... if the extra 
$10 is not included we cannot print and post back.

We realise that there are a lot of ripoffs on the internet 
and you may be a bit sceptical .... but...
PLEASE BE ASSURED THAT THIS IS 100% REAL AND GENUINE ... you WILL receive the recipe for
