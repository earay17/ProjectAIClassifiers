Joke of the Day!

_________________________________________________________________

Sample Jokes:


COUNTDOWN TO DESTRUCTION
On New Year's Eve, a lady stood up at the local pub and said that it was 
time to get ready for the celebrations.

At the stroke of midnight, she wanted every husband to be standing next to 
the one person who made his life worth living.

Well, it was kind of embarrassing. The bartender was almost crushed to 
death.

BARMAID TO ORDER
An eight-year-old kid swaggered into the lounge and demanded of the 
barmaid, "Give me a double Scotch on the rocks."

"What do you want to do, get me in trouble?" the barmaid asked.

"Maybe later," the kid said. "Right now, I just want the Scotch."


__________________________________________________________________


NOT-SO-FAST FOOD
A friend and I were standing in line at a fast-food restaurant, waiting to 
place our order.

There was a big sign posted. "No bills larger than $20 will be accepted."

The woman in front of us, pointing to the sign, remarked, "Believe me, if I=
 
HAD a bill larger than $20, I wouldn't be eating here."
