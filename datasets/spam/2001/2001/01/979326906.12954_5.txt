TO QUALIFY:   ***YOU HAVE A FHA OR VA MORTGAGE LESS THAN 12 YEARS OLD***
                         ***INTEREST RATE 9% OR HIGHER***

TO YOU. WE PAY ALL OF THE CLOSING COST SUCH AS TITLE FEES, RECORDING FEES,
TITLE INSURANCE FEES, AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR LOAN. THIS IS A TRUE
"CAN'T-LOSE" SITUATION FOR YOU AS A HOMEOWNER . IT ALLOWS YOU TO LOWER YOUR 
MONTHLY PAYMENTS WITHOUT ANY EXPENSE TO YOU.

*****ABSOLUTLY NO COST TO THE HOMEOWNER*****

BELOW ARE SOME COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT STREAMLINE REFINANCES.

1. Is this loan truly no cost? YES. We pay all fees incurred for making the loan. Other lenders may
   advertise no out of pocket costs but add it on to the back of your mortgage. We add nothing on
   to your current mortgage balance.

2. Is there an application fee? NO. We do not ask you to pay any fee at all to obtain this loan.

3. Who would benefit most by choosing the streamline "NO COST" program? 1. All homeowners
    with a fixed rate mortgage one half of a percent or more higher than the rate being offered. 2.
    Anyone with an adjustable rate mortgage whose rate has readjusted and wishes to stay with a
    lower rate or prefers the peace of mind that a fixed rate offers.

4. Are there Prepayment penalties? NO. Both FHA & VA do not allow for prepayment penalties of
    any kind.

5. If I pay Money out of pocket can I get a lower rate? YES. However in most cases it would take
    several years to break even on your fees, and in most cases does not make sense to do.

6. What will I need to bring to the CLOSING? THE ONLY TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO BRING ARE
    A PHOTO ID AND YOUR NEXT MONTH'S HOUSEPAYMENT.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING YOUR NEEDS AND SAVING YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
OVER THE LIFE OF YOUR LOAN.
