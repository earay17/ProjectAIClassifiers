We were too!

So we developed a refilling system for every type of cartridge.
Every type of cartridge is refillable.  You just have to have the correct ink and the proper know how.  That's where we come in.
By using our refill system you can save literally hundreds of dollars.  This is a quick an easy system that anyone can do.

Imagine getting up to $400.00 worth for refills for only $35.00
Savings like that can really add up. 
Why you should use a refilling system that is customized for your printer cartridge instead of a universal refilling system?  It is our understanding that no one cartridge is the same. This means that every type of cartridge has different ink and different ways of refilling.  Therefore, some universal systems you may have seen will refill your cartridges, however by using a refilling system that is tailored to your specific printer cartridge you will ensure premium print quality.  

Here are some examples of just how much money you can save by ordering one of our complete kits.

Most HP black cartridges range between 2 to 5 refills.
Most HP color cartridges range between 5 to 7 refills.

Most Cannon black cartridges range between 6 to 10 refills.
Most Cannon color cartridges range between 8 to 15 refills.

Most Compaq black cartridges range between 6 to 10 refills.
Most Compaq color cartridges range between 8 to 15 refills.

Most Epson black cartridges range between 5 to 7 refills.
