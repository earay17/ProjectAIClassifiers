BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! <BR>
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you=
 <BR>
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of <BR>
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devot=
ed <BR>
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to se=
e <BR>
if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or =
<BR>
not the program was legal. <BR>
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws=
 <BR>
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the=
 <BR>
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only <BR>
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF <BR>
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, <BR>
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. <BR>
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I <B=
R>
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am <BR>
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for th=
e <BR>
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ =

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long <BR>

instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. <=

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL <BR>
DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: <BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DOrder all 5 reports shown on the list below =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
 <BR>
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT <BR>
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose <BR>
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN <BR>
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail <BR>
problems. <BR>
=3D=3D=3D When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 rep=
orts. <BR>
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer <BR=
>
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=3D$25.00. <BR>
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from=
 <BR>
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be =
<BR>
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them <B=
R>
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in =
<BR>
case something happen to your computer. <BR>
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next <BR>
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what =
is <BR>
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majori=
ty <BR>
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see=
 <BR>
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been <BR>
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put th=
eir <BR>
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.=
 But <BR>
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and =
then <BR>
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is <BR>
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. <BR>
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! <BR>
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and <B=
R>
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person <BR>
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. <BR>
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. <BR>
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. <BR>
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. <BR>
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 <BR>

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it=
 on your <BR>
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. <BR>
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist =
you with <BR>
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will p=
rovide <BR>
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk =
<BR>
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much m=
ore. <BR>
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: <BR>
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY <BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D <BR>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we =
will <BR>
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's <BR>
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response <B=
R>
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people <=
BR>
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). <=
BR>
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%=
 <BR>
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded=
 <BR>
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,00=
0 <BR>
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=3D100 people responded and=
 <BR>
ordered Report # 2. <BR>
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mail=
s. <BR>
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. <BR>
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-m=
ails <BR>
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. <BR>
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 =
<BR>
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Repo=
rt <BR>
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000.00 (half million). <BR>
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5=
,000 + 4 <BR>
.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=3D$555,550.00 <BR>
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT <BR>
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU <BR>
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! <BR>

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D <BR>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE <BR>
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. <BR>
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even <=
BR>
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are <BR>
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me=
, <BR>
many people will do just that, and more! <BR>
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET <BR>

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds <BR=
>
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet wil=
l <BR>
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # =
1 <BR>
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you <BR>
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide =
<BR>
same day service on all orders. <BR>
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and <BR>
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they <B=
R>
receivethe report. <BR>

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: <BR>
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT <BR>
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 she=
