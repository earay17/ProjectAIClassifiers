Dear Windows User,

Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows ME, 95 and 98 to
nearly the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and=20
industrial version of Windows.

The new WinFix 4.4 is a very effective way to improve the reliability of
Windows, because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing. And
WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of Windows.

http://www4.newsalesjob.net/comph to find out more about WinFix,
the safest, most effective way to keep you working, by keeping your PC
working non-stop.
