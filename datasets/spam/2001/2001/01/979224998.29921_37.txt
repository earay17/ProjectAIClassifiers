The Rebellion of Germs Against Antibiotics

  When Something New And Supposedly Better Comes Along, 
We Leave The Old Things Behind...

Until WE Find That The Old Things Were Really Better!

You'll probably be surprised to learn that prior to 
World War II, the most powerful antibiotic, antibacterial 
and antifungal substance was silver! 

It is called colloidal silver (CS). 

It was doctors' most useful potion because it killed over 
650 different illness-causing organisms-bacteria, viruses 
and fungi. 

This new silver is called "Electrically Generated Colloidal Silver" 
or EGCS. EGCS can now be taken orally or sprayed on a wound, burn 
or rash, and no shots are necessary. Also, the dosage costs dropped from $ 400 to as little as 25 cents each.
