Food For Thought... 
Net spending to hit $1 trillion 
 E-commerce will hit the trillion dollar mark in 2003 
Internet commerce is poised to hit the trillion dollar mark as early as 2003, according to a new study from International Data Corp. 

The Framingham, Mass.-based research firm said that the Web will also become less U.S.-centric, with an estimated 65 percent of Web users coming from other countries by 2003.
 
The online buying phenomenon will be driven by larger purchases, and more shoppers. The number of Web buyers is expected to jump from 31 million in 1998 to more than 183 million in 2003.
