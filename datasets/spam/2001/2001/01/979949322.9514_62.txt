BIG DISCOUNTS, FREE SHIPPING! 
Right now, everything is 20% off.  You will find the catalog prices 
more than satisfactory.  Just imagine buying everything at a 
discount and getting free shipping to boot.   Additionally, I will 
assure all catalog sales with an unconditional, money back guarantee. 

HUGE VARIETY CATALOG! 
I'm writing to let you know about the exciting, new Spring, 2001 
issue of the World of Products catalog, where you can shop with 
more variety and at bigger discounts than at many department 
stores or through their catalogs.  I would like to send you a free 
World of Products catalog.  The World of Products catalog, at 
250 full-color pages, contains over 4,000 items of fantastic gift 
ideas for everyone.  Get all of your shopping done from the 
comfort of your own home and at the best prices possible.   

NO COOKIES! 
My site is a no cookies site.  I promise that you will not have to 
worry about cookies being placed on your computer. Plus, ordering 
is easy.  You can use the shopping cart, secure order form, non-secure 
order form, or you can send your order via regular mail.  The shopping 
cart program has its own server side monitoring system to keep track 
of your shopping cart purchases. 

I hope you will request your free catalog today.  Unlike many other 
retailers, I believe it is an honor to have your business.  Why 
should you be charged for a catalog just to have the privilege of 
shopping with me?  You shouldn't. 

To get your free catalog, send an email to: catalogyes@yahoo.com 
with the word CATALOG INFO as the subject.  Once I hear from you, I 
will provide more information about the catalog.  I know that when 
you get the opportunity to see my online presentation, you will 
absolutely want to have one mailed to you free of charge.   

If you are not interested in my offer, please do not respond to the 
address above as I will assume that responses to that address are 
requests for additional information.  A removal address is below. 

Thank you so much, and I look forward to getting your catalog request 
soon. 

REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS: 
For list removal, just send an email to catalogrem@yahoo.com
with the word REMOVE on the subject line.
