I just found one of the few really useful FREE offers on
the Internet! It's called the Internet Answering Machine.
Essentially it allows you to hear who's calling you while
you're online. Better yet, people who call you won't get
annoying busy signals while you are surfing the net.

This Internet Answering Machine from CallWave installs
in less than a minute. You can get it at

Just thought this might be useful...
