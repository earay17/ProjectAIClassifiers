"This IS a pleasant surprise "!!! 

Simply for accepting our FREE invitation to see this opportunity work for 
YOU, we'll "lock in" your position and EVERYONE who signs up AFTER you, 
signs up UNDER YOU!! You can take your time and review all the benefits 
of your free membership, because frankly, there are too many remarkable 
benefits to be able to understand them all at a glance.

For an example I'm earning guaranteed monthly income whether I do another 
thing in the company or not. For a few months work I have a lifetime income!! 
I will be making a lot more than I am now, you can BET on that.
