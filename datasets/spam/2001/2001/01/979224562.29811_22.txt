Happy New Year!

Let me ask you a question.  Wouldn't you say that its' rather obscene that 95% of Americans die 
prematurely and needlessly form heart disease, cancer and diabetes?  Imagine 95% of your 
entire city suddenly being wiped out.  That is exactly what is happening, but because it's not 
sudden, we accept it as if it was OK!  Sickness is NOT a requirement for living!  Yet too many of 
us do very little to prevent sickness in our lives.  And believe me, much of what ails us CAN be 
prevented.

I am promoting a new way of addressing your health...one that provides your body with essential 
nutrients, which are currently missing from your diet.  When you add these nutrients, the cells 
in your body communicate better which also improves your immune system.

I am also offering you an opportunity to generate extra income in your spare time.  The 
opportunity involves educating, promoting, and recommending these products to your family, 
friends, coworkers, and others.  If the tune of $4,675 in your first 30 days sounds appealing, plus 
you want your health optimized, then please reply with SEND MORE INFO.
