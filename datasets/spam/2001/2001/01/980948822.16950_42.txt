<BR>
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you=
<BR>
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this<=
BR>
letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an=
<BR>
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see i=
f<BR>
it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not=
<BR>
the program was legal. <BR>
<BR>
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws=
<BR>
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the=
<BR>
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25<=
BR>
out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT<B=
R>
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. <BR>
<BR>
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I w=
as<BR>
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I<=
BR>
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal=
<BR>
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.=

Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long<B=

time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in=

the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple<BR>

First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a<=

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME<BR=

TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: <BR>
<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DOrder all 5 reports shown on the list below =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE<BR>
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT<=
BR>
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE=
<BR>
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. <BR>
<BR>
=3D=3D=3D When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 rep=
orts.<BR>
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and=
<BR>
resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=3D$25.00. <BR>
<BR>
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from=
<BR>
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be<=
BR>
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them fr=
om<BR>
you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case<=
BR>
something happen to your computer. <BR>
<BR>
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to ea=
ch<BR>
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is<BR>
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majori=
ty<BR>
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see=
<BR>
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been <BR>
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put<BR=
>
their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the<=
BR>
money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be<=
BR>
greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other<B=
R>
than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.<BR>
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! <BR>
<BR>
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and<BR=

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist<=

you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purcha=
se<BR>
will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how =
to<BR>
send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads<=
BR>
and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: <BR>
<BR>
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY <BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D <BR>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we<=
BR>
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's=
<BR>
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response<BR=
>
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people<B=
R>
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).<B=
R>
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. <BR>
<BR>
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 peop=
le<BR>
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of<B=
R>
those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=3D100 people<=
BR>
responded and ordered Report # 2. <BR>
<BR>
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mail=
s.<BR>
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. <BR>
<BR>
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million<BR>
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # =
4.<BR>
<BR>
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000<=
BR>
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Repo=
rt<BR>
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000.00 (half million). <BR>
<BR>
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....<BR=
>
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=3D$555,550.=
00 <BR>
<BR>
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE=
<BR>
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF=
<BR>
MONEY ! <BR>
<BR>

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU=
<BR>
MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or hal=
f<BR>
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There<=
BR>
are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believ=
e<BR>
me, many people will do just that, and more! <BR>

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of<=
BR>
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will<B=
R>
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # =
1<BR>
and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must=
<BR>
do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same<=
BR>
day service on all orders. <BR>
<BR>
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and<BR>
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they<BR=

receive the report. <BR>
