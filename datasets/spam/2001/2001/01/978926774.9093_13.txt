    "6 BARGANING TIPS FOR A BETTER DEAL”
  
   By Lawrence Kellie
                     

My wife works in retail sales; in fact, she is the second in command
of the fabric store she works in. Because of that, she comes 
across 
all types of people who try all types of tactics to get something 
for much less than the list price. She has even had customers out 
right lie to her.... This is not an assumption; people have been 
caught.

With that in mind, here are some bargaining tips that won't leave
you hated by the store!

 1. Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained.
There is nothing inherently wrong with asking for sales, as long as 
you ask nicely. I remember shopping for a very expensive 
Christmas gift for our son, and I asked if the store know if it was 
going to go on sale before Christmas. This is perfectly acceptable. 
After all, the point of the sales people is to make the sale! 

 2. Shyness and Cryness.
If you are too shy to ask for information about bargains, you just 
may "cry" when you get home! This goes along with No. 1 above. 
Don't be shy. For the most part, no one will hurt you. 

3. Obnoxiousness.
Don't be obnoxious about the entire process. I know that 
some "bargain tips" advice you to stall. This is down right rude!
 Nothing stronger can be said. Monopolizing the sale's person's 
time will only bring about animosity. Don’t do it. 

4. Quantity Discounts.
Ask if the store offers quantity discounts. Some do, some 
don't. If they do, and you ask, then you are farther ahead. 

5. Defects.
There are many "bargain" tipsters who will advice to 
search studiously to find something wrong with the item. 
Again, this can be taken to the point of
dishonesty. Many stores will reduce the price some for a 
defect. However, scrutinizing with a microscope is going a little 
too far. Also, the store may have already reduced the item for that 
defect. 

 6. Honesty.
Finally, play honest. Leave a good impression when you 
leave. Act in such a way that the next time you come in,
the sales persons will be more than eager to help you. 
They won't dread seeing your face. After all, is it worth 
a couple of cents to keep a good name?
