Hello,


A few months ago, I received an email from you (or someone using your address)  
requesting info about a web site dedicated to finding programs that ACTUALLY 
work. Due to some family health problems, I was unable to continue my work 
on it, and so I did not reply.  Now, I am back and this is the info you requested.

I*f you did not request the info, or have no interest after reading this message, please 
REPLY with the word REMOVE in the Subject Line.  That's all.

To help refresh your memory, I will repest the previous message:

"The purpose of this email is to invite you to join a a new free web site and forum.
Its purpose is to find programs that REALLY offer an opportunity to earn money on 
the Web (no get rich quick schemes).  In addition, members will provide opinions
on programs they have tried, software they have used in their marketing and/or 
membership web sites that have a genuine value.  

The web site and forums will be run by its members, so you will have an opportunity
to shape its development.  The links on the Web site will take you to forums on 
different areas of interest to the members.   Each forum has the capability for members 
to rate a topic (program) and poll members for their opinion(s) on specific topics (programs).  
That will allow us to be more definitive as to what we think about a particular program 
purporting to be a money earner.

The forum board is free, and you might want to check it out if you think you 
may have a use for one.  Hope you'll decide to join.  If interested, please REPLY with the
word FORUM in the Subject Line.  

If you wish to be removed from this mailing list, please REPLY with the word REMOVE in
the Subject Line.  

P.S.  People who join the (free) Straight Shooter Web site may have a free Autoresponder 
        that offers ten follow-up messages (personally, I can never think of that many different 
        messages to send) and will have no advertising messages from me or anyone else on 
        any emails sent from your free Autoresponder.  

         I purchased the auto-responder software for the purpose of spreading my messages 
         with every response made to someone requesting info from one of my free Autoresponder 
         users.  That's what the other "free" services do.  However, I decided it would be of greater 
         value if used as a benefit to people joining the Straight Shooters Web site.  

         I need people to help me with the site.  Moderators for different forums are particularly 
         needed.  For those who become moderators, I will give free space to host their own 
         web site.  I am paying for 50 mb of space and have no use for at least 49 mb of it.  
         Most sites seldom need more than 1-2 mb of space, unless they have a lot of pictures 
         and/or store large software programs for download.  My site has a need for neither.  
         Your free web site will have no advertising, other than your own, and will have a short URL.

Cordially,

Steve Radcliff

of my emails.  Surely sounds legalistic, doesn't it?  Oh well ....
