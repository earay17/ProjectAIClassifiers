EARN $1000 EVERY TIME SOMEONE SPENDS $89!

If YOU did not make at least $2,000 last week. then 
you'd be FOOLISH not to check this out! 


"I sent out a 1000 piece fax blast, got 25 calls, 
had 14 messages, and signed up 11 people! That's 
$11,000 in one week! Thank you God!"
Derrick Alexander. - Atlanta,GA


"WOW! I needed to make ALOT of MONEY immediately when 
I started, for some BILLS! Did I ever! My first DAY I 
made $6,000! Thanks to all the FREE tools and help 
from my sponsor, my life will never be the same!"     
David Webster. - Newport Beach,CA

This is the most explosive income opportunity I've 
ever seen! It's NOT an MLM! There are NO MEETINGS, 
INVENTORY, or STRESS! You simply operate a wholesale/
retail business. You market a fabulous travel package 
that earns you $1000 PER SALE! With $89 down we approve 
98% FINANCING making this EASY TO SELL! AND EACH 
CUSTOMER BRINGS YOU 2 SALES WORTH ANOTHER $2000 IN 
YOUR POCKET! 

Eventually you'll MAKE $5000 A WEEK IN YOUR UNDERWEAR..
ANSWERING THE PHONE! SEE FOR YOURSELF.  CHECK US OUT!
