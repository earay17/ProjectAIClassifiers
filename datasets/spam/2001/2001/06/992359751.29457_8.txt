SEARCH ENGINES DELIVER TARGETED UNIQUE TRAFFIC TO WEB SITE

If you don't find what you're looking for in the first 10 to 40 
matches ON A SEARCH ENGINE, what do you do? 
If you are like most people, you simply go to the next 
search engine and try again.

If your site is not coming up in the TOP 40 matches 
On a search engine, you're losing MONEY!

IT 'S THAT SIMPLE!

Improving search engine TRAFFIC means:

MORE HITS
MORE BUSINESS
MORE SUCCESS

The most important advertising dollar 
being spent should be for search engine TRAFFIC.

1. Approximately 95% of all Internet users start 
with a search engine query.

2. Anyone who comes to your site from a major search 
engine is 100 times more likely to become a customer 
because they were specifically looking for your product, 
goods or services.

3. Search engine traffic gives you substantially more 
for your advertising dollar than banners. Moreover 
Banners are done on impressions.  An impression is 
just someone that went to a web page with your 
Banner ad on the page. It does not mean your Ad 
was seen.

You Can't Get Your Companies Web Site Indexed by the Search Engines?

Unfortunately, this is all too common of a Problem. 
You're not the only one frustrated about the length 
of time it takes to be listed, or all the pitfalls involved. 
It takes anywhere from 2 days to as much as 6 months to be 
listed on all the search engines. Waiting several weeks to 
months can be extremely frustrating. 

WHEN TO DO YOUR SUBMISSION?

Engines can at any time delay their indexing for maintenance 
and many other reasons. 

So do you feel lucky? Do YOU?

Lucky if you submit A PAGE just days before an engine does a complete 
refresh of their many indexes/databases.
