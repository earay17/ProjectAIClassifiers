Hello,


Do you know that there are organizations that are willing to
pay you to read emails? Yes, it's hard to believe but it's
true. Internet is not a only a place for free stuff but also
a place to pocket in some extra cash.


This whole thing is plain and simple. After you sign up, just
watch out for that email. When that email arrives just click
on the given link and if you need to sign-up for some sort of
programs just try it out. After that if you are not satisfied,
then you can just remove yourself from the program. You are
also paid for doing that!


You might be asking yourself, where does this advertising
company get the money to pay email readers just to read
emails. Well, this all comes from advertising revenue that
this advertising company gets when they distribute advertising
emails of other companies and commercial websites to its
members. A portion of that revenue will go to its members for
reading the advertisements and trying out products or
services.


So, are you interested? If you are then reply this email with
the subject "request info" to request for an invitation.
Otherwise reply with the subject "REMOVED" to prevent from
receiving any emails in future.


Thank You.
