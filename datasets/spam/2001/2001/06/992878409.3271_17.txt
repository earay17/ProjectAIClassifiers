Hi! Excuse me for my reference to you, I simply do not have other output from my
problem. My child dies, at him a heart disease and to him operation is urgently necessary,
but I do not have money for this operation. Please, help me though something. I shall be
glad even to the small sum of money, you see it will help to rescue life of my son. I hope
that with your help I shall collect the necessary sum of money. Beforehand to you it is
grateful!

Olga Georgieva
