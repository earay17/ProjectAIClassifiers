CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER
COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR CGPE !!!
 
This Wednesday CGPE will be profiled by some major newsletters
There will be huge volume and a strong increase in price for
several days. These are the same newsletters that profiled
MYPT two weeks ago. They brought MYPT from $ .66 to $2.57
in ten days. We know for certain that the same groups are
going to profile CGPE starting on Wednesday.
 
We are very proud that we can share this information with
you so that you can make a profit out of it. It is highly
advisable to take a position in CGPE as soon as possible,
today before the market closes or tomorrow. 
 
The stock is trading near its 52-week low and will start
moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily
reach $3 in less than a month.
 
Good luck and watch CGPE fly this week!
