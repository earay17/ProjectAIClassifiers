<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">However, I read about this scheme in the newspaper and then saw it on TV and thought … why not give it a try? Someone is going to make money out of this, why shouldn't it be me?</P>
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">This scheme claims that people can make over half a million dollars ever every 4 to 5 months from their home for a one-time investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars.
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">Yeah right? That was my reaction too … but if you do the maths you can see where they are coming from.
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or<FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#800000" SIZE = "3"> <FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">not the program was legal.<FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#800000" SIZE = "3"> <FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">Their findings proved once and for all that there are "absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make a lot of money with only $25 out of pocket cost". 
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3"><B>DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY AND RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. </B>
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#0000FF" SIZE = "3">This is what existing users had to say: 
<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#800000" SIZE = "3">"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".

<P><FONT FACE = "Comic Sans MS" COLOR = "#800000" SIZE = "3">"This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and to NOT change anything.

I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received a total of $147,200.00 all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby".
