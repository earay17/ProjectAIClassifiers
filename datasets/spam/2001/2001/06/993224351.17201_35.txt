How long has it been since your partner said: I want you soo bad ?? 

Trouble is, with all the daily pressures and lack of time, very few couples are in the mood by the time the day is through. 

This is one reason why Viagra sales have skyrocketed.

Its safe, doctor recommended, and you dont need a prescription.  (Were soon comingout with a version for MEN). 

Women are buying it.  Men are buying it for their partners.
