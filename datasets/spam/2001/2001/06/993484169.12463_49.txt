SO HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE? 

For many modern women, the answer is "Not so hot."  Studies have shown that 
women achieve orgasm during intercourse only 25% of the time-many women end 
up "faking it," or just going through the motions.  That adds up to a lot of 
sexual frustration! 

But now there's finally the same kind of sexual help for women that medical 
science has provided for men.  It's called VIACREME, and it comes from the 
Pfizer family of healthcare products.
