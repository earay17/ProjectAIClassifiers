Current Price:  $0.45
52 week high:  $5.75

This coming Tuesday CNMT will be profiled by a major
newsletter. Huge volume and a strong increase in price
is expected for several days.

We feel that with a 52 week high of $5.75 per share
CNMT has tremendous upside potential!

Total revenues increased $332,000 or 10.2% to $3,589,000
for the three months ended March 31, 2001 from $3,257,000
for the three months ended March 31, 2000.
