   "There is absolutely NO WAY for the average person to make 
   money on the Internet!"  
   
   "They are ALL SCAMS and only STUPID people fall for them!"
   
   
   Or so I thought....
   
   Those "really were" my exact words just 10 months ago, 
   after spending more than a year working dozens of MLM 
   and affiliate programs.
   
   And you know what?  I was absolutely wrong!
   
   What I found one day, was an email very similar to the 
   one you're reading right now, that talked about joining 
   a home business mentorship program.  

   The purpose or function of this program was to do all the 
   necessary research FOR you, to search out and test the 
   REAL opportunities on the net and to show you the 
   secrets to succeeding where most people fail in these 
   businesses.

   My decision to respond to that email changed my life!
