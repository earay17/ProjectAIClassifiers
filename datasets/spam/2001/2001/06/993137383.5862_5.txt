Is it possible?

Is it possible there's an Oil & Gas company that is
trading at $3.00 a share that has PROVEN reserves that
would value the stock at $35 a share according to
Bloomberg's method of evaluation?

Everybody knows undervalued stocks are the place to
invest. But what about undervalued energy stocks? Is
it
possible they exist in this market? When California is
running out of electricity (generated by Natural Gas)
and gasoline is reaching all time highs (while
gasoline
companies are making record profits on Oil)? 

Want a very surprising answer?
