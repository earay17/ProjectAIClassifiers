THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY=2E=20

It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work=
, and best of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mai=
l=2E If you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've bee=
n waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your dream=

ke advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!=20

The longer you wait, the more people will be doing business using e-mail=2E=
 Get your piece of this action!!!=20

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability=2E  It is be=
ing taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and =
the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods =
and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1=
990's=2E This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millio=
naires in the U=2ES=2E, 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last sever=
al years in MLM=2E Moreover, statistics show 45 people become millionaires=

You may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump mad=
e an appearance on the David Letterman show=2E Dave asked him what he woul=
d do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch=2E  Without =
hesitating,  Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and=
 get to work=2E  The audience started to hoot and boo him=2E  He looked ou=
t at the audience and dead-panned his response "That's why I'm sitting up =
here and you are all sitting out there!"=20

With network marketing you have two sources of income=2E =20

Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales=
 made by people you introduce to the business=2E=20

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy=2E  It means investing time o=
r money once and getting paid again and again and again=2E In network mark=
eting, it also means getting paid for the work of others=2E=20

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers=
=2E Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought=
 and study to it=2E=20

My name is Jonathan Rourke=2E Two years ago, the corporation I worked at f=
or the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated=2E Afte=
r unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business=2E Over t=
he past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems=2E I owed my f=
amily, friends and creditors over $35,000=2E The economy was taking a toll=
 on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet=2E  I had to re=
finance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling bus=
iness=2E AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am=
 writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life =
FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!=20

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail=2E  Six month's prior =
to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on vari=
ous business opportunities=2E All of the programs I received, in my opinio=
n, were not cost effective=2E They were either too difficult for me to com=
prehend, or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if i=
t would work or not=2E  One claimed that I would make a million dollars in=
 one year=2E=2E=2Eit didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!=20=


But like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program=2E  I d=
idn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list=
=2E THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make su=
re I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes=2E=20

Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON=2E=20

I could invest as much as I wanted to start, without putting me further in=
to debt=2E  After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at =
least get my money back=2E But like most of you I was still a little skept=
ical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all=2E So I checke=
d it out with the U=2ES=2E Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they co=
nfirmed that it is indeed legal!  After determining the program was LEGAL =
and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided "WHY NOT=2E"=20

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails=2E  It cost me about $15 for my time o=
n-line=2E  The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for=
 printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are fulfil=
led via e-mail, the only expense is my time=2E I am telling you like it is=
, I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "=
rip-off" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me=2E=20

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1=2E B=
y January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1=2E Your goal is to "R=
ECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS=2E IF YOU DON'T, SE=
ND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"=20

My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done=2E By January 30, I ha=
d received 196 orders for  REPORT #2=2E  Your goal is to "RECEIVE AT LEAST=
 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS=2E IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAM=
S UNTIL YOU DO=2E  ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY=2E  RELAX, Y=
OU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL=2E"=20

Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed=2E So I sat ba=
ck and relaxed=2E=20

By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming=
 in every day=2E  I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car=
=2E Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIF=
E FOREVER!!!=20

Remember, it won't work if you don't try it=2E This program does work, but=
 you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rules of not trying to place =
your name in a different place=2E It won't work=2E  You'll lose out on a l=
ot of money!  In order for this program to work, you must meet your goal o=
f 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+  orders for REPORT #2, and you will m=
ake $50,000 or more in 90 days=2E I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!=20

If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry=2E  It really=
 is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you=2E If you choose t=
o participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial=
 security=2E=20

If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was=
, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign=2E I DID!=20=

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:=20

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should hav=
e concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have bee=
n created by an amateur=2E=20

Let me tell you a little about myself=2E I had a profitable business for 1=
0 years=2E Then in 1979 my business began falling off=2E I was doing the s=
ame things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working=2E=
 Finally, I figured it out=2E It wasn't me, it was the economy=2E Inflatio=
n and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us sinc=
e 1945=2E  I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate=
=2E=2E=2Ebecause many of you know from first hand experience=2E  There wer=
e more failures and bankruptcies than ever before=2E=20

The middle class was vanishing=2E Those who knew what they were doing inve=
sted wisely and moved up=2E  Those who did not, including those who never =
had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the poo=
r=2E As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER=2E" =
 The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "move up"=
 or "get rich", inflation will see to that=2E=20

You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for=
 the rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT=2E=
"  You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagi=
ned=2E=20

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor any=
one else who has provided a testimonial for this program=2E I have already=
 made over 4 MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the program after sendi=
ng out over 16,000 programs=2E Now I have several offices that make this a=
nd several other programs here and over seas=2E=20

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED=2E Do not change it in any way=2E=
 It works exceedingly well as it is now=2E Remember to e-mail a copy of th=
is exciting report to everyone you can think of=2E One of the people you s=
end this to may send out 50,000=2E=2E=2Eand your name will be on everyone =
of them!  Remember though, the more you send out the more potential custom=
ers you will reach=2E=20

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and oppor=
tunity to become financially  independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!=20

**********************************************************

"THINK ABOUT IT"=20

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a =
little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT=2E=20

Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate=2E  Fig=
ure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, yo=
u will still make a lot of money!  You will definitely get back what you i=
nvested=2E Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in=2E=
 IT WORKS!  Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA=20

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$=20

INSTRUCTIONS:=20

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME=2E I am sure t=
hat you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days=2E  Before you=
 say "BULL=2E=2E=2E ", please read this program carefully=2E  This is not =
a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity=2E  Basical=
ly, this is what you do: As with all multi-level businesses, we build our =
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products=2E  Every sta=
te in the USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and=
 we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent=2E  YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND=
 ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling=2E  You=
 do it privately in your own home, store or office=2E=20

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:=20

This is what you MUST do:=20

Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you do=
n't order them)=2E=20

For each report, send $5=2E00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU AR=
E ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL AND ADDRESS, YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case o=
f a problem) and to the person whose name appears on the list next to the =
report=2E=20

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROB=
LEMS!=20

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports=2E=
  You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your compute=
r and resell them=2E=20
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports=2E=
 Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to =
the 1,000's of people who will order them from you=2E=20

2=2E=09IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed nex=
t to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is =
instructed below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the majo=
rity of your profits=2E Once you understand the way this works, you'll als=
o see how it doesn't work if you change it=2E Remember, this method has be=
en tested, and if you alter it, it will not work=2E=20

Look below for the listing of available reports=2E=20
After you've ordered the four reports, take this Advertisement and remove =
the name and address under REPORT #4=2E This person has made it through th=
e cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!=20
Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4=2E=20
Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3=2E=20
Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2=2E=20
Insert YOUR NAME/address in the REPORT #1 position=2E Please make sure you=
 copy every name and address ACCURATELY!=20

3=2E=09Take this entire letter, including the modified list of=20
names, and save it to your computer=2E Make NO changes to the Instruction =
portion of this letter=2E=20

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can af=
ford $20)=2E You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail =
is FREE!=20

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 4 reports =
you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which =
includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classif=
ied ads and much, much more=2E=20

There are two primary methods of building your downline:=20

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL=20

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'=
ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each=2E =
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0=2E5% response=2E  Using a =
good list the response could be much better=2E  Also, many people will sen=
d out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000=2E But continuing=
 with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs=2E With a 0=2E5% resp=
onse, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1=2E=20

Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of =
20,000=2E Out of those 0=2E5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2=2E =20=


Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of  200,000=2E The 0=2E=
5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3=2E=20

Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total=2E The 0=2E=
5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4=2E That's 10,000 $5 bil=
ls for you=2E CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5=
,000+ $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!=20

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL T=
O WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A M=
OMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INS=
TEAD OF 2,000=2E=20

Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost=
 to participate in this is practically nothing=2E You obviously already ha=
ve an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!=20

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you wher=
e to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists=2E=20=


METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET=20

Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS =
of FREE places to advertise=2E  Let's say you decide to start small just t=
o see how well it works=2E  Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to p=
articipate on your first level=2E (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the intern=
et will EASILY get a larger response=2E) Also assume that everyone else in=
 YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members=2E=20

Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below:=20
1st level-your 10 members with $5=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=
=85=85=85=85=09$50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 $5 x 100)=85=85=85=85=85=85=85=09$500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)=85=09$5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k)=09$50,000
THIS TOTALS =09$55,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recrui=
t 10 people each=2E Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 pe=
ople to participate! Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT=
!  For every $5=2E00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the repor=
t they ordered=2E THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS=
! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and ad=
dress on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receiv=
e the report!=20
