Additive Could Help Solve California's Gasoline Crisis!

BAT International Inc. (OTCBB:BAAT) announced that its
partially owned subsidiary company -- Dolphin Automobile Company Inc
has signed a contract to supply Millennium Fuels Corporation (MFC)
with an additive package that would eliminate the lead in fuels
while providing superior octane and other performance characteristics
without MTBE.
 
The announcement comes on the heels of a flurry of newspaper
and media announcements that the federal government will soon make
public its decision not to grant California an exemption to the
Clean Air Act.
 
As a timely coincidence on the same day (June 11, 2001) the front
page of many newspapers across the country, including the L.A.
Times, read "Gas additive rule won't be waived," "No waive, EPA
said." The L.A. Times article said that: "The Bush Administration
plans to deny California's request for exemption from a federal
gas rule that state officials say would increase already rising
prices at the pumps" (see L.A. Times article June 11, 2001).
 
It could also cost California drivers as much as $450 million a
year to replace MTBE with ethanol and could trigger fuel shortages.
 
The article also stated: "The decision is likely to increase
the friction between Davis and the White House, already at odds
over electricity price controls. It also would complicate Davis'
efforts to phase out the gas additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl
ether), which has polluted ground water."
