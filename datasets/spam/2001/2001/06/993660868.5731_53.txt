Please be advised that the .CA extension of your domain name may not be registered yet.  This email message is to remind you that if your domain is not registered, anyone will be able to own your .CA name.  Since there can only be one registrant per unique .CA name, you will not be able to register for it anymore if someone else registers the name first.

To verify the status of your .CA domain or to register, please go to http://www.GetDotCa.com now.

Cordially,


Domain Co-ordinator

ABOUT .CA DOMAIN EXTENSIONS
***************************************************
The .CA domain is a country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) designated for the nation of Canada. Much like a country's telephone code, different ccTLDs have been assigned to various nations that have developed Internet infrastructures. Contrary to common myths, the .CA name is fully accessible by users worldwide, just like a .com name. The difference is there a set of restrictions to registering .CA domain names.
