There Is More To Protecting Your Business' Future Than Buying A Domain Name!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

By Bill Platt<p>

I bought my own domain name in March of 2000. I was in hog heaven; 
I was finally a real business. Now, I am a business in transition 
once again. 
<p>
When I bought my domain name, I checked the Whois network to make 
sure my selected name was clear. Much to my relief, it was. So, I 
bought the Domain Name, started building my site, and started 
promoting like a mad dog. Less than 2 months after moving to my own 
domain, I am generating over 6,000 hits each month to my site. 
<p>
I have firmly established myself under my domain name, and I have 
created an environment on the Internet where I have over 300 links 
pointing to my dot com site. I worked 16 hours a day to build the 
site to its current level and to get all of those links established. 
I am now starting to make some decent money from my website for the 
first time ever. 
<p>
And then BAM! It happened. 
<p>
I received a certified letter in the mail from a lawyer in Seattle, 
Washington. It seems a very large company owns the trademark on one 
of the words in my domain. I have managed to negotiate a settlement 
with them giving me 60 days to complete my transition, but after 
that 60 days, I must give up every single reference to the 
Trademarked word completely! Ouch! 
<p>
In the course of the last few days, I have learned some new things 
about protecting your business from a nightmare like this. Too bad I 
did not know this information two months ago! Fortunately, due to 
this article, you have the opportunity to not make the mistakes I 
have made. 
<p>
Just a few days ago, I would have told you that there are only three 
steps involved in getting started as an Internet based company. The 
first would have been to find a domain name that you are comfortable 
with. The second would have been to visit 
http://www.TotalNIC.net/whois.html to do a search to make sure your 
selected domain name was open. And the third was to find a reliable 
and affordable web host for your domain services. 
<p>
Of course, that is the simplistic view, because it does not take 
into account the design and the construction of your website. It 
also does not take into account getting your e-commerce set up or 
anything like that. Basically, this simplistic view was the three 
steps that you would need to take to get rolling. 
<p>
But, the events that I have dealt with over the course of the last 
few days has changed all of the forever. Now, I will insist that 
there are actually six steps in this simplistic view of the process. 
Steps four, five and six can be taken care of all in one website. 
That website is: 

http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/search.html 
<p>
Step Four:<br> 
Learn about the Trademark and Servicemark laws. 
Basically, the way I so far understand it, anyone can purchase a 
trademark or sevicemark without the aid of an attorney, though they 
do recommend that you use an attorney for your own protection.

Trademarks and Servicemarks are used for product based companies and 
service based companies, respectively. In effect, what they do is to 
protect a name or a certain word in the eyes of the business world.
<p>
Now, Trademarks and Servicemarks are not entirely unique to the 
company who owns them. They also have product and service categories 
attached to those "marks". Thus, Nikon could not have challenged me 
using the name "F5" because I had "F5" attached to a computer based 
business, and they have "F5" attached to a camera product. Different 
types of product and service categories allow more than one company 
to own a Trademark or a Servicemark on a particular name. 
<p>
HINT: Don't trust my understanding of Trademarks and Servicemarks as 
the God-honest interpretation. Talk to an attorney who specializes 
in this industry for a God-honest interpretation. 

The general idea behind these "marks" is to prevent the consumer 
from getting confused between two companies offering similar 
products with similar names. 
<p>
Step Five: <br>
Visit http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/search.html and 
search for your selected name in one of the Trademark search engines. 
If your selected name is "marked" already, then check 
the "marks" to see what industry the "mark" represents. 
<p>
Step Six: <br>
If your "mark" is clear, BUY IT! The do-it-yourself 
Trademark will cost you a mere $325 for 10 years. 

If that seems like a lot of money, then stop to remember me. I have 
to give up my domain, and I lose the money I used to purchase it. 
Then think about my 16 hour days over the last two months. Then 
think about those hundreds of links out there that will be dead 
links in less than 60 days. Then think about the fact that I will be 
going from 6,000 hits a month to probably less than a hundred hits 
in my first month at my new domain. Then think about all of the work 
that will be required to move from one domain to the other, and 
change all of the references from my old domain name to my new 
domain name.
<p>
$325 in comparison to all of the time and goodwill I will lose and 
have lost on this deal, is just a drop in the bucket of what it 
could have saved me. 
<p>
Let me put this another way for you. Do you remember the Dick and 
Jane stories we read when we were kids? 
<p>
See Bill do his homework. <br>
See Bill buy his domain name. <br>
See Bill in hog heaven. <br>
See Bill work hard. <br>
See Bill work long hours. <br>
See Bill promote the domain like a mad dog. <br>
See Bill do this for two months. <br>
See Bill check his mail. <br>
See Bill read his important looking letter. <br>
See Bill chew his nails. <br>
See Bill lose everything he had worked hard for in a flash. <br>
See Bill eat a bottle of aspirin in one week. <br>
Don't be a Bill. <br>

10 Tips For Making Your Site More Usefull
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

By Carole Pivarnik <p>

People rely heavily on Web sites that are most useful to them. They 
go to Dictionary.com to look up or translate words. They go to 
BankRate.com to use financial calculators. They go to 
SmallBusiness.com to get and give business advice. They go to 
Coupons.com to save money. They go to 1800flowers.com to quickly and 
easily order gifts for loved ones. They go to HomeDepot.com to learn 
how to install a ceiling fan. 
<p>
All of these sites and others with a large, loyal visitor base have 
one thing in common: they provide a useful service or product to 
their visitors. Usefulness is one of the key factors in attracting 
repeat traffic. Here are some tips for making your site more useful 
and more competitive: <p>

1. Teach something. <br>
There is a huge demand for concise, well-written how-to information. 
If you have a business Web site, you have an area of expertise. What 
can you teach your visitors? <p>

2. Simplify a complex task. <br>
Many tasks are so complex that people have difficulty figuring out 
where to start and what to do. Some examples are buying a home, 
changing careers, or starting a business. By providing checklists, 
online wizards, or other tools to organize and automate complex 
tasks, you can make those tasks significantly easier for your visitors. <p>

3. Offer extraordinary value. <br>
People calculate value by comparing what they get to how much it 
costs. Value exists for them when they perceive that they're getting 
more than they pay for. If you offer an expensive product or 
service, create value by showing how the benefits of purchase exceed 
the cost. If market conditions make it difficult for you to compete 
on price, increase the value of your offer by packaging it 
with "free" add-ons or companion products. <p>

4. Provide superior quality. <br>
In today's competitive market, people simply expect high quality. To 
wow them, your site must provide that extra feature, service, or 
customer care that puts you in a different league than your 
competitors. <p>

5. Offer unparalleled convenience. <br>
People take the path of least resistance. Make it a snap to find and 
use your Web site. Make it easy to remember. Design it for easy 
access. Make it clear what visitors can get from you and where they 
can get related material that you don't offer. <p>

6. Assist with decision-making. <br>
People often have trouble sorting out the details that go into 
complex decision-making. Provide them with an organized, easy way to 
do that and they'll love you for it. For instance, a small business 
portal might offer a checklist or worksheet that helps entrepreneurs 
figure out what paperwork they must submit to local and state 
government to incorporate their business. <p>

7. Invite participation. <br>
Allowing your visitors to participate in forums, share advice, 
publish articles, or otherwise interact with other visitors creates 
a sense of community. Since we all like to belong, sites that 
provide valuable communities for visitors tend to foster great 
loyalty among them. <p>

8. Give something for nothing. <br>
People respond to getting good stuff free. Can you offer something 
free for which your competitors charge? Can you offer more or better 
free stuff than your competitors? <p>

9. Differentiate. <br>
Take a close look at your competitors' sites. What do they lack? Set 
your site apart from theirs by offering a different mix, more 
content, better quality--whatever it takes to rise above the din. 
And then make sure you tell visitors why your site should be their 
first choice. <p>

10. Diversify. <br>
Offer your audience as many different reasons as possible to find 
your site useful. Offer content, tools, and services for different 
levels of expertise, areas of interest, or professional focus.<p>

Conclusion <br>

By providing a more useful site, you encourage your visitors to not 
only return frequently, but linger. This can greatly increase the 
chance that they'll become paying customers. Take the time to 
carefully assess your site and make changes that enhance its 
usefulness. Doing so is one of the best investments you can make 
in your Web site and your business. <p>

few days has changed all of the forever. Now, I will insist that 
there are actually six steps in this simplistic view of the process. 
Steps four, five and six can be taken care of all in one website. 
That website is: 

http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/search.html 
<p>
Step Four:<br> 
Learn about the Trademark and Servicemark laws. 
Basically, the way I so far understand it, anyone can purchase a 
trademark or sevicemark without the aid of an attorney, though they 
do recommend that you use an attorney for your own protection.

Trademarks and Servicemarks are used for product based companies and 
service based companies, respectively. In effect, what they do is to 
protect a name or a certain word in the eyes of the business world.
<p>
Now, Trademarks and Servicemarks are not entirely unique to the 
company who owns them. They also have product and service categories 
attached to those "marks". Thus, Nikon could not have challenged me 
using the name "F5" because I had "F5" attached to a computer based 
business, and they have "F5" attached to a camera product. Different 
types of product and service categories allow more than one company 
to own a Trademark or a Servicemark on a particular name. 
<p>
HINT: Don't trust my understanding of Trademarks and Servicemarks as 
the God-honest interpretation. Talk to an attorney who specializes 
in this industry for a God-honest interpretation. 

The general idea behind these "marks" is to prevent the consumer 
from getting confused between two companies offering similar 
products with similar names. 
<p>
Step Five: <br>
Visit http://www.uspto.gov/web/menu/search.html and 
search for your selected name in one of the Trademark search engines. 
If your selected name is "marked" already, then check 
the "marks" to see what industry the "mark" represents. 
<p>
Step Six: <br>
If your "mark" is clear, BUY IT! The do-it-yourself 
Trademark will cost you a mere $325 for 10 years. 

If that seems like a lot of money, then stop to remember me. I have 
to give up my domain, and I lose the money I used to purchase it. 
Then think about my 16 hour days over the last two months. Then 
think about those hundreds of links out there that will be dead 
links in less than 60 days. Then think about the fact that I will be 
going from 6,000 hits a month to probably less than a hundred hits 
in my first month at my new domain. Then think about all of the work 
that will be required to move from one domain to the other, and 
change all of the references from my old domain name to my new 
domain name.
<p>
$325 in comparison to all of the time and goodwill I will lose and 
have lost on this deal, is just a drop in the bucket of what it 
could have saved me. 
<p>
Let me put this another way for you. Do you remember the Dick and 
Jane stories we read when we were kids? 
<p>
See Bill do his homework. <br>
See Bill buy his domain name. <br>
See Bill in hog heaven. <br>
See Bill work hard. <br>
See Bill work long hours. <br>
See Bill promote the domain like a mad dog. <br>
See Bill do this for two months. <br>
See Bill check his mail. <br>
See Bill read his important looking letter. <br>
See Bill chew his nails. <br>
See Bill lose everything he had worked hard for in a flash. <br>
See Bill eat a bottle of aspirin in one week. <br>
Don't be a Bill. <br>

People rely heavily on Web sites that are most useful to them. They 
go to Dictionary.com to look up or translate words. They go to 
BankRate.com to use financial calculators. They go to 
SmallBusiness.com to get and give business advice. They go to 
Coupons.com to save money. They go to 1800flowers.com to quickly and 
easily order gifts for loved ones. They go to HomeDepot.com to learn 
how to install a ceiling fan. 
<p>
All of these sites and others with a large, loyal visitor base have 
one thing in common: they provide a useful service or product to 
their visitors. Usefulness is one of the key factors in attracting 
repeat traffic. Here are some tips for making your site more useful 
and more competitive: <p>

1. Teach something. <br>
There is a huge demand for concise, well-written how-to information. 
If you have a business Web site, you have an area of expertise. What 
can you teach your visitors? <p>

2. Simplify a complex task. <br>
Many tasks are so complex that people have difficulty figuring out 
where to start and what to do. Some examples are buying a home, 
changing careers, or starting a business. By providing checklists, 
online wizards, or other tools to organize and automate complex 
tasks, you can make those tasks significantly easier for your visitors. <p>

3. Offer extraordinary value. <br>
People calculate value by comparing what they get to how much it 
costs. Value exists for them when they perceive that they're getting 
more than they pay for. If you offer an expensive product or 
service, create value by showing how the benefits of purchase exceed 
the cost. If market conditions make it difficult for you to compete 
on price, increase the value of your offer by packaging it 
with "free" add-ons or companion products. <p>

4. Provide superior quality. <br>
In today's competitive market, people simply expect high quality. To 
wow them, your site must provide that extra feature, service, or 
customer care that puts you in a different league than your 
competitors. <p>

5. Offer unparalleled convenience. <br>
People take the path of least resistance. Make it a snap to find and 
use your Web site. Make it easy to remember. Design it for easy 
access. Make it clear what visitors can get from you and where they 
can get related material that you don't offer. <p>

6. Assist with decision-making. <br>
People often have trouble sorting out the details that go into 
complex decision-making. Provide them with an organized, easy way to 
do that and they'll love you for it. For instance, a small business 
portal might offer a checklist or worksheet that helps entrepreneurs 
figure out what paperwork they must submit to local and state 
government to incorporate their business. <p>

7. Invite participation. <br>
Allowing your visitors to participate in forums, share advice, 
publish articles, or otherwise interact with other visitors creates 
a sense of community. Since we all like to belong, sites that 
provide valuable communities for visitors tend to foster great 
loyalty among them. <p>

8. Give something for nothing. <br>
People respond to getting good stuff free. Can you offer something 
free for which your competitors charge? Can you offer more or better 
free stuff than your competitors? <p>

9. Differentiate. <br>
Take a close look at your competitors' sites. What do they lack? Set 
your site apart from theirs by offering a different mix, more 
content, better quality--whatever it takes to rise above the din. 
And then make sure you tell visitors why your site should be their 
first choice. <p>

10. Diversify. <br>
Offer your audience as many different reasons as possible to find 
your site useful. Offer content, tools, and services for different 
levels of expertise, areas of interest, or professional focus.<p>

Conclusion <br>

By providing a more useful site, you encourage your visitors to not 
only return frequently, but linger. This can greatly increase the 
chance that they'll become paying customers. Take the time to 
carefully assess your site and make changes that enhance its 
usefulness. Doing so is one of the best investments you can make 
in your Web site and your business. <p>
