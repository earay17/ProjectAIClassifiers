<body>
<p>I sincerely apologize if you are receiving this e-mail in error.<br>
<br>
I have been taking an herbal formula for 10 months and it has saved my 
family<br>
and my life. Because of this I have made a commitment to get the word out 
on<br>
this<i> life-changing</i> product, so that it will be available to everyone.
<br>
<br>
My name is Dana Hampton. I'm a married 37-year-old mother of 4 who was a<br>
happy size 7 before my first child and who grew 4 dress sizes larger by 
my<br>
fourth pregnancy.<br>
It's amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you 
simply<br>
don't want to face up to.<br>
I didn't like the way I looked and I didn't like the way I felt. I was at 
the<br>
point where I just didn't want to live and have to face another day.<br>
<b><font lang="0" color="#ff0000">I
WAS SICK OF BEING FAT!</font></b><font lang="0" color="#000000" size="2"><br>
</font><font lang="0" color="#ff0000">I
FELT THAT I OWED IT TO MY HUSBAND, MY FOUR CHILDREN, AND MYSELF TO MAKE 
ONE<br>
MORE ATTEMPT AT WEIGHT LOSS.</font><font lang="0" color="#000000"><br>
I have researched and tried many weight loss programs during my &quot;
yo-yo<br>
dieting&quot; years. I did Slim Fast, Cybervision, Atkins, soup diets,
starvation,<br>
&quot;exercise and eat no fat,&quot; chromium picolinate, metabolic enhancers,

and<br>
more. You name it, I tried it!<br>
I lost some pounds with every diet, but eventually gained them back, 
usually<br>
with a few extra pounds. On every one of those diets, I lost energy, and<br>
eventually had to eat a lot to feel better. I was grouchy with a short fuse.
<br>
This even happened during the diet where I exercised and ate less with 
only<br>
low-fat foods, the better-known &quot;right way&quot; to lose weight. I'm 
sure
losing<br>
weight that way works OK for many people, but it just didn't work very 
well<br>
for me.<br>
It seemed my metabolism froze, and I was going to stay at that weight<br>
forever, but I wanted to look better and be healthy. I was very depressed 
and<br>
disappointed. I dieted on and off, but got nowhere. The weight kept<br>
returning.<br>
I suddenly realized just how difficult this weight problem had really become.
<br>
Now I understood why so many people have the same problem.<br>
<br>
I almost gave up. Then, I remembered something I heard from old my friend<br>
Janie. She told me about a company who makes a nutritionally-engineered<br>
weight loss product, which </font><font lang="0" color="#ff0000">ACCELERATES
WEIGHT LOSS</font><font lang="0" color="#000000">.
It was developed by<br>
European Scientists and had been kept a secret for years, UNTIL NOW.<br>
Scientists from an American Nutriceutical company met up with their top<br>
scientist and brought the secret here. It is a unique product, called<br>
BerryTrim Plus, and<br>
<i><br>
</i><b><u>NO OTHER PRODUCT HAS THESE INGREDIENTS</u>.</b><br>
<br>
It sounded too good to be true. I didn't want to get all hyped up about 
some<br>
new program, and I didn't want to add one more diet to my failure list.<br>
What really made me decide to try it were all the testimonials I read on<br>
their web site, written by so many Doctors, Celebrities, and people like 
you<br>
and me.<br>
<br>
I called for my 30-day supply and was so amazed when only after the first 
3<br>
days, I began to experience a sense of &quot;well being&quot; - something I
hadn't felt<br>
for months, maybe years. I felt ENERGIZED, not to mention my 
sugar/chocolate<br>
cravings were absolutely gone!<br>
<br>
<b><u>I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE I FELT!</u></b><br>
<br>
I began to hope again - maybe I could lose this old weight. I gave this<br>
pursuit up months before and had boxed up my smallest clothes to give away!
<br>
After 5 weeks of BerryTrim Plus I had already lost 10 inches off my hips 
and<br>
thighs and,<br>
<br>
<b>OH JOY! I FINALLY SEE MY WAIST LINE!<br>
</b><br>
Not to mention,<br>
<br>
<b>THE SCALE WAS ACTUALLY SPINNING BACKWARDS AND SHOWING A<br>
<br>
TREMENDOUS WEIGHT LOSS!<br>
</b><br>
</font><font lang="0" color="#ff0000"><b>THE
BEST PART IS, I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY I ATE, WHAT I ATE,<br>
OR ADD AN EXERCISE ROUTINE TO MY DAILY REGIMEN. ALL I DID WAS USE THE<br>
PRODUCT, AND THE WEIGHT SIMPLY CAME OFF…<br>
EASILY AND SAFELY! THAT'S IT.</b></font><font lang="0" color="#000000"><br>
<br>
Well, now today I'm 4 dress sizes &amp; 7 jean sizes smaller + 26½ inches 
are<br>
gone!<br>
</font><font lang="0" color="#ff0000">I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!
</font><font lang="0" color="#000000"><br>
I really wish I could show you how I looked 10 months ago compared to how 
I<br>
look now. The differences are unbelievable. I recently traveled and when 
I<br>
had to show a picture I.D. at the airport for security reasons, the 
airline<br>
agent asked for &quot;another&quot; form of picture I.D. because my driver's
license<br>
picture doesn't look like me anymore!<br>
<br>
It's kind of embarrassing receiving all of the compliments about how &quot;
great
I<br>
look&quot; now. It's even more embarrassing to mention it. But they keep 
coming.<br>
The greatest compliment I got was from my husband, Recently, he told me,<br>
&quot;Olivia, you really look great, you look like the young girl I kissed at
our<br>
wedding.&quot; I said, &quot;WHAT?&quot; He told me that I &quot;looked
younger&quot;. He said my face<br>
looked especially younger, &quot;you look like the real you!&quot;<br>
It was true, just like everything I had read about the product. It all 
came<br>
true!<br>
That was a first for any weight loss program I had ever tried.<br>
The changes that took place were both subtle and obvious. Here are some 
of<br>
them:<br>
<b>MY ATTITUDE IMPROVED<br>
I HAVE LESS TENSION AND ANXIETY<br>
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY FAMILY IMPROVED<br>
QUALITY OF MY SLEEP IMPROVED<br>
I NOW SLEEP THROUGH THE ENTIRE NIGHT<br>
I HAVE GREATER ENERGY<br>
COMPULSIVE EATING DECREASED<br>
CRAVINGS FOR SWEETS DECREASED<br>
I HAVE LESS FREQUENT HOT FLASHES<br>
NO LONGER DRINK CAFFEINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY<br>
NO LONGER SLEEP FOR HOURS IN THE AFTERNOONS<br>
NO LONGER EXPERIENCE DISCOMFORT WITH MOVEMENT.</b><br>
I feel better now than I've felt in years. Thanks to BerryTrim Plus and<br>
Janie, who introduced me to it.<br>
I invite you to try it for 30-days. I promise you'll be calling for more 
soon<br>
after!&quot;<br>
Look, if you want to try out this product, it can change your life. If 
you<br>
don't want to, that's OK too. At least find some way to lose weight that<br>
works for you. Your life will change after you lose the weight. Many 
people<br>
won't try it because they won't believe it. Unfortunately, with all the<br>
marketing and scams out there, we all have to be skeptical. If I tried to<br>
hand out fifty dollar bills on a city sidewalk, most people would not take 
it<br>
because they would think it was some kind of trick. This is not a trick. 
It<br>
worked for me.<br>
Whether you need to take off five pounds or five hundred, this will help 
you<br>
do it in a healthy way. The company has a 60-day money-back guarantee, and 
I<br>
called to check on that. They get practically no returns and 92% re-orders.
<br>
That says it all if you ask me. You order directly from the company and use 
a<br>
credit card. Their link is at the end of this story. , Click through this<br>
website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for 
so<br>
many people like you and me!<br>
<br>
I can assure you that I would not publicly put my credibility on the line<br>
unless everything I have told you here was 100% true. So, do take a look 
at<br>
the many success stories from others who have gained better health, 
improved<br>
their relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it off 
for<br>
good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this is<br>
something you are willing to try - GO FOR IT!!!!! You won't be sorry. Do 
take<br>
the time to read them. Many are more AMAZING than my own!<br>
