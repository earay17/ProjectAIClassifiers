**** Did You Know? ****

Did you know that a conservative investment strategy may 
sound like a good idea, but it isn't, especially if you are 
under ago 40. In order to keep up with inflation, you must 
invest your money for growth, and the younger you are, the 
more aggressive you can afford to be with your investment 
strategy. As a general rule, if you are going to invest your 
money for at least 10 years, you should invest most of it for 
growth. Also, you should remember that in a retirement account 
any gains, interest, or dividends are, in most cases, tax-deferred. 
In a Roth IRA, in most cases, earnings are tax-free. What this 
means is that in a retirement account, your tax money as well as 
your account's growth goes to work for you. This can make a 
tremendous difference in the accumulation of your money.

Another One Bites the Dust
by Gail Hornback

Its becoming a common occurrence.  Another free E-Service 
discontinuing its free option.

This week it was Listbot.  Listbot, a division of Microsoft, 
has been one of the leading free mailing list services for 
quite sometime now.  In fact, it has some sentimentality for 
me since it was one of the services that was instrumental in
the early stages of my Ebusiness experience!  It allowed me
to get my feet wet, and establish my ezine before I had any
capital to invest in necessary resources.  Luckily for me, I
had made the transition in my own timing!  Unlike many others
who are now forced to find other option.

Of course, Listbot has given their thousands of free service
customers six weeks to get their lists together and find 
another option.  And, of course, Listbot is giving all those 
thousands of customers their NEW list server option - at 
$149 for the "first year".  I noticed they placed that word 
"first" in the announcement too, for whatever that's worth.

The internet has been a boom-town, gold-rush kind of place over
the past few years.  It wasn't that long ago that there were
free E-Services EVERYWHERE!  From free list servers, to free
websites, to free ISPs and free hosting services.  But things
are obviously changing.  The promotional value of free is 
apparently not a forever kind of thing.

Other examples of free services pulling the plug:

1) Yahoo -  Recently began charging a fee to apply for a listing.
To get listed on Yahoo now, you must pay a fee and submit your 
site. There is no guarantee you will get listed and the fee is
not refundable.

Existing listings are effected because the spyders are programmed.
They've also implemented a number of rules that qualify a site for
acceptance or rejection. For instance, splash pages or mirror pages 
and also meta tags are ignored. The search goes to page content.
You apply for a listing and hope they accept you. If you are in 
good standing you stay. The old listings will be filtered out over 
time so it doesn't cause a shock effect. In other words, sites like 
Microsoft and all the big guys are protected. Obviously, its a great
way to weed out the little guys.

2) BigStep - Free site and hosting services. The changes they 
made put quite a few people in a bind, too. They suddenly 
announced to their users that the service would be going to
9.95 a month.  Of course, they gave them 30 days to 
opt in or not. BUT -if users wanted to leave and go somewhere
else, they couldn't download or salvage the sites they put all 
the work into with the online builder because there is no FTP. 
It was pay, or lose their site. On top of that, if users did opt
to pay the $9.95 a month and keep their site, they STILL got
the BigStep Promo Banner at the top of their site. What a deal!

(*Note:  There IS a way to salvage a BigStep site. A little work, 
but do-able. If you are in this predicament, get in touch with us, 
and we will help you through.)

These are only a couple of examples.  It's happening everywhere.
Is it a process that was always in the plan? Kind of like the old
bait and switch?  Hard to say. And it doesn't really matter.  It's 
happening everywhere.  And Ebusiness owners  need to 
take notice - and stay ahead of the plan!

Don't ever put all your eggs in one free basket!!!  Keep in mind
that the trend is snowballing. Spend the time necessary researching
products that you can afford, that will give you the quality service
your Ebusiness can depend on.  Don't be forced into a hasty decision
because the plug has been pulled on you.  You've worked too hard
to get this far!!

**** Thought to Ponder ****

Starting a home-based business is the American Dream for a growing 
number of entrepreneurs. To take advantage of that dream, however, 
you first have to place your feet on the road and start walking. 
Here are the factors you must consider before embarking on your 
own business venture:

* Your primary reason for being in business for yourself.
* The amount of risk capital available.
* The amount of credit available.
* Your skills.
* Your likes and dislikes.
* The amount of effort you are willing to expend.
* Your financial goals.
* Whether you can begin full- or part-time.
