              I wanted to let you know about this service I found,
I have not needed to go to the video store. I have been able to 
find and download full length newly realesed Movies, and Music,
Music videos to, I have even found Video games. And once you 
download all these things they are saved to your hard drive and 
they are yours to keep for ever!
              I only pay $3.95 a month for all this, if you have a CD 
burner you can even burn the Movies,Music and shear them with 
your friends they will be able to watch the movies on there CD 
rom drives.

          P.S. I paid $9.00 for two sodas last week at the theater!!!
