FASTEX-CDT opens the door for literally millions of women and men who have been unable to "jumpstart" their metabolism due to the associated risks of typical thermogenic products.
In clinical studies, FASTEX-CDT' s advanced thermogenic components have been proven to yield the following results: a 76.9% increase in a person's resting metabolic rate was achieved immediately after taking the product, in other words, the person's body started burning fat as soon as they took the product; people had a near 30% greater weight loss than other prescribed weight loss supplements they had taken before
 FASTEX-CDT; clients reported up to a 42% reduction in total body fat after using FASTEX-CDT; and FASTEX-CDT was determined twice as safe as asprin and four times as safe as Tylenol. This supplement is considered to be the weight loss discovery of the century.
