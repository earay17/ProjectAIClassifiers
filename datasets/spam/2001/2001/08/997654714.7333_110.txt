TranStar Holdings, Inc.

             TRANSTAR'S LORAIR LTD. DIVISION ESTIMATES                                              
                REVENUES OF $ 96 TO $ 120 MILLION
                              
   The Industry
Supplemental air carriers make money! Pilots,who are not salaried, are paid well for their hours flown; without the expensive benefit packages of commercial airlines.  This results in huge savings for the carrier and profits for the shareholder.  Aircraft, due to age and 
use, are well maintained according to FAA Regulations, but come to air carriers at a discounted lease rate. There are few F.A.R. supplemental carriers in the United States, the demand for charter air services, as of this date, and into the foreseeable future, 
is far greater than supply.
 
   The Company
TranStar Holding, Inc., TNNS is a multi-dimensional company in the Telecommunications, and Customer Service related industries. Its common stock is electronically traded and is listed on the National Quotation Bureau's pink Sheets (*www.pinksheets.com).
TNNS has a history of moving rapidly when opportunity presents. This year TNNS acquired Gerlatch Communications Holding Group Inc., and LorAir LTD. LorAir, Ltd. is a certified "Supplemental Charter Air Carrier".  LorAir services special contact requirements to Hotel/Casinos, tour operators, U.S. Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Forestry Service.  LorAir has international charter rights and has flown to Canada,
Mexico, and the Caribbean. LorAir has completed negotiations with Jet Owner (RLLP) which will supply LorAir several passenger aircrafts valued at $25 million. 
 
   PFI News Alert!
Rarely does this editor see a company coming out of nowhere making 8 to 10 million a month.  Don't miss this one guys!
 
   Investment Considerations
TNNS is extremely undervalued and has a huge upside potential. LorAir a division of TNNS estimates full operation in the next 90 days, with 5 additional aircraft being added at regular intervals. These aircrafts will service major casino contracts in development.
The company projects that the gross passenger revenues will reach $8 to $10 million dollars per month with an estimated 28% to 30% Net Earnings. That is 2,240,000 a month, or 26,880,000 a year or $2.37 eps. If the company accomplishes 1/3 of what it anticipates, 
and the stock is only trading for 1 times its eps that equals $.79 per share.To reach the short goal we again divided this by three, which gave us a price of .26 eps. Airlines typically trade between 15 and 20 times eps.  If the company achieves it's goals
expect us to raise our estimates substantially. In addition to that, Gerlatch Communications Holding Group, Inc., is a telecommunications company that owns approximately 1,400 pay phones.  There is an additional 1000 pay phones being installed. This represents another 
1.8 million dollars in revenue.  TNNS holding's most important goals are to continue to increase shareholder value and to maximize profits.  Further more, TNNS plans in furthering its market value by applying for NASDAQ or AMEX listings in the near future.  
If LorAir, Ltd. Division of TNNS meets its estimated revenues of $ 96 to $ 120 million a year, TNNS stock could literally "Soar on the wings of LorAir".
