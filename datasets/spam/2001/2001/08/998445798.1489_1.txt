ACTION ALERT:  NU ELECTRIC CORPORATION

Listed: OTC Bulletin Board
2001 Price Range: $.38 - 1.89
Recent Price: $.64
Shares Outstanding: 4.7 Million
Estimated Float: 1.4 Million

In a rebuff to President Bush, the Republican-led House of Representatives 
recently voted 218-189 to require the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) 
to implement a tough new standard against arsenic in tap water. A likely 
beneficiary is Nu Electric (“NRGE”), a small pure-play company marketing a 
patented process for arsenic removal. With the stock down about 80% from the 
August 2000 peak of $3, a new look could be profitable for investors.

In 1999, the National Research Council found that arsenic in water can cause 
bladder, lung and skin cancer.  The report estimated that the cancer mortality 
rate among individuals who drank water containing 50 parts per billion (the 
current standard) was 1 in 100 - a higher risk factor than the EPA has ever 
allowed for all of the other substances it regulates in drinking water. The 
proposed new level of 10 parts per billion could take effect when the EPA’s 
new budget kicks in sometime after October 1.

NuElectric is an incubator company that is the product of two acquisitions.  
Clean Water Technologies (arsenic) was purchased in 1999. They are also
developing Zorax, Inc. (acquired in September 2000), which has an exclusive 
license for a technology that extracts and identifies dangerous cryptosporidium 
and giardia, two waterborne parasites that can cause serious gastrointestinal 
problems.  The current allowable parts per billion allowed by the EPA for these 
two organisms has already been set...at zero.

This past Friday, NRGE announced that they were considering another technology 
merger. The acquisition target has an electronic system developed by a nationally 
known research facility. "Since the new technology is already patented, we could 
hit the ground running with it," stated President Laurie C. Scala. 

NRGE tends to be volatile, and the small floating supply has led to rapid price 
increases in the past when buying pressure comes in. They have been an SEC 
fully reporting company since January 2000, and financial information is available 
at the usual major web sites. We believe that Nu Electric presents an attractive
buying opportunity before the U.S. Senate votes on the issue after the August 
recess.
