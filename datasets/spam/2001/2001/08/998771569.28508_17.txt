<br><b><A href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/gcenter/gcenter.cgi?iquote=CBYI&PERIOD=3M&equote1=&equote2=&equote3=&EXCH=US&T=markets_gcenter99.ht&x=45&y=15"><u>Click HERE for a QUOTE & recent NEWS!</u></A></b>

<p><b>RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY.</b>

<br>

Hold on tight for the largest Oil and Natural Gas expansion in U.S. History.  Demand for Energy is at its highest level putting

tremendous

pressure on Scientific & Technical Instrumentation companies like CBYI.  There is rapid expansion in the

energy industry with the

need for more power plants and cheaper fuel.  CBYI is a major benefactor of the growing need

because it supplies specialized

"Smell Technology" analyzers for industrial applications in Natural Gas production and

transmission.  The current industry revenues

exceeds $900,000,000 and should reach a triple digit growth rate for the next five or more years.  Estimates today indicate that

there could be as much as $25 billion in revenues from "smell technology" by the end of 2003.

June (AMCN) & July (PAGI)
