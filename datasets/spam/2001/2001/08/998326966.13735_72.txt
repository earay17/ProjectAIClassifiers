It appears that Wall Street is convinced the technology sector is likely to improve in the second half of the year, which should bring back the Bull Market. Our current recommendation, Elite Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: ETCH), is a technology company positioned to re-test its past 18 month $3.00 trading range. This is the right time to take advantage of the Company’s current trading prices. ETCH is a company with real revenues, state of the art products, and a worldwide distribution network. ETCH is a full service technology company that is primarily focused on the hardware distribution and communications sector of the technology industry. ETCH, through its acquisition strategy of medium sized companies, each with its own specific synergistic qualities, will provide a wide variety of products and services, creating efficiency and profits via a world wide distribution network.

Products offered by ETCH

ETCH offers over 600 products and components through its subsidiary companies. Two products ETCH offers that are very appealing to our staff are the Internet Kiosks and Business Centers. These products allow the user to browse the Internet, retrieve e-mail, send and receive faxes, make copies, word process and perform other Internet-based activities on a pay by the minute system. Both products are provided to hotels, airports, and other high traffic travel related locations. 

The proprietary kiosks and business centers were developed by AMG Ltd. and are marketed by IET, both subsidiaries of ETCH.

The kiosk is developed for domestic and international business, allowing the user to have secured Internet browsing, free telephone calls, web portals for booking travel arrangements as well as business-to-business portals for facilitating international trade, providing the procurement of goods from foreign markets. ETCH created vertical versions of the kiosk for hotels, airports, and other high traffic travel related locations that specialize as business centers allowing faxing, copying, scanning, video conferencing, word processing and other useful tasks while eliminating the need for staffing. ETCH has recently announced it eliminated more than 2 million dollars of debt from its balance sheets. 

Investment Opportunity

ETCH is currently in negotiations with companies in the United States, Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico for exclusive distribution agreements for its products. ETCH has already signed distribution agreements with companies throughout the Southeast, the Caribbean and South America. ETCH intends to expand its world wide distribution network for its products by the end of 2002. ETCH recently acquired ICON Computer Parts in Puerto Rico, an $8 million per year revenue Company, to handle its South America/Caribbean distribution. 

Reasons to Own Stock

ETCH expects to do $50 million this year, $100 million next and reach more than $250 million in revenues by fiscal year end 2003. With a conservative 10 times earnings, far below industry standards, the stock will easily see $2.00/share over the next few months. The stock has $3.00 support levels within the past 18 months. Don’t miss this one.
