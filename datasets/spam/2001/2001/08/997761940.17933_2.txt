BOTTOM LINE IF YOUR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS CAN'T find <BR>
YOUR WEB SITE in the first 10 to 20 matches ON <BR>
A SEARCH ENGINE, YOU JUST LOST MONEY!</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT color="#FF00FF"><B> IT 'S THAT SIMPLE!</B></FONT> <BR>

<FONT color="#FF0000"> MORE HITS<BR>
MORE BUSINESS<BR>
MORE SUCCESS<BR>
<BR>
</FONT> <BR>
The most important advertising dollar <BR>
spent should be for search engine TRAFFIC!<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> 1.</B>  Approximately 95% of all Internet users start <BR>
with a search engine query.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> 2.</B>  Anyone who comes to your site from a major search <BR>
engine is 100 times more likely to become a customer <BR>
because they were specifically looking for your product, <BR>
goods or services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> 3.</B>  Search engine traffic gives you substantially more <BR>
for your advertising dollar than banners or anything else.<BR>
Moreover having a Banner ad on a web site doesn't mean your Ad <BR>
was seen or even targeted to your market.<BR>

<FONT color="#FF0000"> Can't Get Your Companies Web Site Indexed by the Search Engines?</FONT> <BR>

<FONT color="#FF0000"> Unfortunately,</FONT>  this is all too common of a Problem. <BR>
You're not the only one frustrated about the length <BR>
of time it takes to be listed, or all the pitfalls involved. <BR>
It takes anywhere from 2 days to as much as 3 months to be <BR>
listed on all the search engines. Waiting several weeks to <BR>
months can be extremely frustrating. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT color="#0000FF"> WHEN DO YOU SUBMIT?<BR>
</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
Engines at any time delay their indexing for maintenance <BR>
and many other reasons. <BR>
