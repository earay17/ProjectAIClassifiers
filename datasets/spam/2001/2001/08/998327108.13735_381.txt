<b>RAPIDLY GROWING INDUSTRY.</b>
<br>
Hold on tight for the largest Oil and Natural Gas expansion in U.S. History.  Demand for Energy is at its highest level putting tremendous
pressure on Scientific & Technical Instrumentation companies like CBYI.  There is rapid expansion in the energy industry with the
need for more power plants and cheaper fuel.  CBYI is a major benefactor of the growing need because it supplies specialized
"Smell Technology" analyzers for industrial applications in Natural Gas production and transmission.  The current industry revenues
exceeds $900,000,000 and should reach a triple digit growth rate for the next five or more years.  Estimates today indicate that
there could be as much as $25 billion in revenues from "smell technology" by the end of 2003.    
<p>
Our last 2 recommendations, STEM & NCCL are up over 300% from the price we recommended in our June (STEM) & July (NCCL) Newsletters!
<br>Acquire a position in CBYI TODAY!
