Do you remember our previous conversations where you said...

"If only I could find an easier way to make money"
and.........

"If I had more money, I could spend more time with my family,
and less time at work"
and.........

"I sure could use more money so I could pay off all my bills
once and for all"

Well its possible we haven't actually met before but you did
not receive this letter by mistake, I just felt that everyone
in the world deserves to know about, and should be given a
chance to get in on this amazing program. I think every one
can spare $25.
Please read this letter and you will see what I'm talking about.
Thanks so much.......

Dear Friend,

When you start to read this letter I want you to read it slowly,
sit down, and then read it again. The first time I read this letter
I didn't believe a word it said, the second time it started to set
in just how much money someone can really make with this program.
Well, about 5 months ago I decided to give it a try. My total investment
was
$110.00.
That covered the five $5 bills I sent as outlined below, and a
bulk e-mailer.  From  that $110 I have made over $17,000.
That may not seem like a lot of money to some people but it sure
helped me out this year. Now you don't have to take my path your
total investment can be $25 and with the reports from those
listed below, they will direct you to free ad. sites, the best
targeted e-mailers and a lot more. All in all I believe this business is
the best one on the Internet....
Please read on......

Greetings,

Hopefully my name is still on the list. I am a retired attorney.
Approximately, two years ago a man came to me with a letter similar
to this one. He asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal.
I told him I would review it and get it back to him. When I first read
the letter a week and a half later, we met in my office to discuss the
letter. I told him that the letter he originally brought me was not 100%
legal and I advised him to make a small change in the letter so
it would be.

I was still curious about the letter, so he proceeded to explain how
the letter works. I thought it was a long shot and decided against
participating. However, before my client left, I asked him to keep
me updated as to his results. About two months later, he called to tell
me he had received over $25,000 in cash. I did not believe him.
He suggested that I try his idea and find out for myself. I thought
about it for a couple of days and then I realized I had nothing to lose
only some money to gain. If nothing else, I would make my investment
back, so I asked him for a copy of the letter. I followed the
instructions
exactly, mailed out 100,000 e-mails and sure enough,
the money started arriving. It came slowly at first but after three
weeks I was getting more mail in than I could open in a day.
After about 3 months , the money stopped coming in. I kept a precise
record of my earnings and at the end they totaled $38,493.

I was earning a good living as an attorney. However, as anyone in
the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes
with the job.
I told myself that if things really started working out, I could retire
from my practice and play golf with in a few years. I decided to try the
letter again, but this time I sent out 500,000 e-mails. Well, three
months later, my earnings totaled $69,178. I just couldn't believe it. I
met with my old client for lunch to find out why or even how this letter
was working so well. He told me that there are five names on the list
instead of six and with this program your only sending $5 to those five
people instead of $10 each. That fact alone resulted in many more
returns. The other part was guaranteeing that the whole program was
legal since no one wants to risk participating in something illegal.

I'll assume by now you are curious to know what little change I told him
to make. Well, If you sent a letter like this out, to be legal
you must actually sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. I
told him that anyone sending him money must expect to receive something
in return. So, when you send the $5 to each of the 5 people on the list,
you must include a slip of paper with the words, "Please send me Report
number _____ to my email address of __________________________".
This is the KEY to the program !

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW EXACTLY, and in less than three
months you will receive over $20,000 or more !!!
Instructions:

1. Immediately send $5.00 cash (no checks please) to each of the five
names listed below, and remember to include a note requesting that
they send you the report
that you are ordering, and be SURE to give them your email address !
This is the step that makes this system legal...

2. Then send $5 place between two sheets of paper.  Make sure you
give your correct address, and email address.  Please print it legibly.

3. Remove the name in the number five position and move each of the
other names and addresses down  one place { number one becomes number
two, two becomes three, three becomes four, and four becomes five} Put
your name and address in the first position.

4. Start sending out e-mails with a targeted e-mail company so you
can start receiving orders.

5. Finally, save this letter so you can use it over and over again.

Once again, this letter is not a chain letter, but perfectly legal
way to make money. {Refer to Title 18 sections 1302 and 1342 of the
United States Postal and Lottery Laws}

Last Thoughts:

We waste money in lotteries, enter sweepstakes and clip coupons.
We need to invest in one another. Perhaps you are not in need of money.
Then do it for someone else! Do it for a friend, a neighbor, college
student, endowment fund, camp, etc.  Let's help to fulfill everyone's
dreams!

Just think how much money you can make with this program, instead of
just throwing this letter away keep it, save the $25 up and invest.
If everyone gets involved we can all make our financial dreams come
true.

When you start receiving orders for Report #5, you will feel like
you're making money as fast as a Gas Pump! :-)

1. NO  face  to  face  selling,  NO  meetings,   NO
inventory,  NO  Telephone  calls,  NO  big  cost  to
start, Nothing to learn, NO skills needed!
(Surely you know how to send e-mail?)

2. NO equipment to buy - you already have a computer
and internet connection - so you  have  everything
you need to fill orders!

3. You are selling  a product which  does  NOT  COST
ANYTHING TO PRODUCE OR SHIP! (e-mailing copies  of
the reports is FREE!)

Thank You and Good Luck!
