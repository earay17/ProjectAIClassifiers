AFRICANWOOD - The All-Natural Alternative to the "wonderdrug" for Erectile Dysfunction.
Also a great sexual stimulant that will liven up your sex life whether you are male or female!!

It really works!

ONLY 19.95 for 3 Nuts!  This means you can have up to SIX USES (average)
for less than you pay for TWO uses of the usual "treatment".  Note Africanwood is an
all-natural nut---straight from an African tree----and therefore not regulated by the FDA.
You use the product how you see fit!

Africanwood is not a potion---it is not processed.  It is simply the nut of an ancient african tree,
and best of all, IT WORKS!  Unbeknownst to most, Africans have been using the nut for its
stimulating properties for thousands of years!  Prolongs erections, increases sensitivity,
enhances sexual pleasures.

The scientific name for this particular variety of nut is "C. acuminata," and this variety is only
available in a very small area in a West African country.

FOR MORE INFORMATION CLICK HERE:

Traditional uses include:
 - impotency
 - stimulating a weak heart
 - treating nervous debility
 - weakness
 - lack of emotion
 - nervous diarrhea
 - depression
 - despondency
 - brooding
 - anxiety sickness

There are many potions, powders and pills available that are "natural," but what most
people don't realize is that most natural remedies work best ONLY in their natural state.

The key constituents of the AfricanWood nut are theobromine, tannins and phenolics,
inlcuding d-catechin, I-epicatechin, kolatin, and kolanin.  All of these substances are
completely natural and work ONLY when the nut is fresh!

Order your nuts today, and see why the African culture has held this nut in such high
regard for so many centuries!
