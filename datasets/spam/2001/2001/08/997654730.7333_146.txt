DO NOT GAMBLE WITH YOUR MONEY!!!

"The Only Way To Make Money In A Casino Is To Own One".

The independent and overwhelming success of both the internet and gaming industries
are sure indicators of the profit potential that can be achieved through the effective merger

gaming market could soon reach $20 billion in annual revenue.

In other words: Internet Technology + Legalized Gaming = Profits
