## SFI AFFILIATES, BEAT THESE NUMBERS!! ##

"Nothing can stop the march of an idea whose time has come!"
- Stan Stuchinski

over 500,000 of the 1.2 Six Figure Income Member's 
aren't making over $10.00/mo. Gary Sargeant had over 1,100 in
his SFI downline and was making $8.00/mo. He's now Promoting
Big Dogs and within 5 weeks, Gary's making over $2,100/mo.
and Gary never made a dime on the Internet Before!!

If you're an SFI diehard, Great!! You need email leads!!
Our program will give you 20,000 to mail to each day
so you can actually be one of the successes in SFI!!

THAT'S 600,000 EMAIL LEADS EACH AND EVERY MONTH!!

Brian Garvin was the 300th in the Program and is making
over $1,800/mo. in residual income within 3 weeks and 
made over $5,500 in cold hard cash in the "Sheriff's" Pocket.

Many of Brian's Downline members have had over 20 sales
within one week, following straightforward tips in the manual.

With the "Big Dog" Program, you'll earn $960.00/mo. 
by referring 20 full C.H.I.P. members not counting front
end sales AND one time commissions (this is all explained in
the "Secrets of the Big Dogs" Manual).

After these 20 refer just 10, you'll be earning $5,818.00
each month. But there's 10 more levels of compensation left.

Yes, there are fees and it will take work, but YOU can
do it. Anyone Can. Gary Sargeant was not an established
"Web Guru". In fact, he never made a dime on the internet
and even lost thousands (like almost all newbies do) before
"Secrets of the Big Dogs". And he didn't have a large 
budget. Neither did any of my downline members who
have made over 20 sales already.

You'll have to work 1-2 hours per day.
You'll receive 20,000 daily email leads.
You'll receive complete marketing materials.
You won't be making Cold Calls.
You won't recruit people using Dirty Tricks.
You'll NEVER get ripped off again.
You do NOT Need a Website.

You'll receive the ## Big Dog Bulletin ## for life,
even if you never spend a dime other than the $19.95
One-Time Fee to access "Secrets of The Big Dogs".

Once you join, just sell the $19.95 manual, and the
program does it's magic. An extensive training site
will be up soon, so you can just keep selling and
answer occasional questions instead of spending all
day training your downline.

If you're tired of Lies and Games, give us a try. 
The money is 100% refundable so there's NO risk.

There are NO bonus ploys to distract you from what
you REALLY need to accomplish, that's retire
within 6-12 months (that's a reasonable figure...)

I hope you have the courage to make 
the right decision. I'd love to have you on my team.

P.S. Once you purchase "Big Dogs", you'll 
receive my email address and Phone Number and you'll 
receive my downline report, also free for life.
