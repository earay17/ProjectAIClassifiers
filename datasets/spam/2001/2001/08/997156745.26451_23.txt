Dear Sir/Madam,

BFSCORP.COM- $245

I am a domain name broker and have been tracking the
domain name BFSCORP.COM which expired and became
available
for a very short period today. I registered it
immediately that it became available on behalf 
of a client. However on contacting this client a
short while ago to notify her of this successful
registration, she informed me that she will not be 
proceeding with her venture . If you have an interest
in acquiring this domain, please contact me at your
earliest convenience. I will be contacting
anyone who I feel may have an interest and have priced
it for a quick sale.

All transactions are 100% secure and are transacted
with the largest e-commerce company on the net. The
transfer process is extremely simple and you can also
be confident that with Namegiant.com, you are dealing
with a reputable company and will receive all the
assistance and support that you may require throughout
any transfer process - and beyond. 

If this email is of no interest, I appologize for this
intrusion and can assure you you will not be mailed
again. This is a one-off approach because we felt this
development could be of genuine interest to you and
your company. If it isn't, once again, please let me
convey our sincere appologies.


Kind regards,



Colin
Sales
www.namegiant.com 

Please note that the whois system takes a couple of
days to update before it will be reflecting our
registration. Thank you.
