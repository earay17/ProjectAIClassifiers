<p>Hi! My name is Angela Westin. I got your e-mail address off a post. Ple=
ase forgive me if I made an error; I'm a two-fingered typist. I put this l=
ittle note together to show people that it's not impossible to lose any am=
ount of weight that you want! I hope you find this information useful.<br>
<br>
I'm married, with 2 boys, ages 14 and 12.<br>
<br>
I was getting bigger every year. My weight had hit 264 pounds at age 38. F=
or my height and build, I should have weighed about 175 pounds. That was 8=
9 pounds overweight, clinically obese. My parents were concerned that I wa=
s overweight, and growing larger. Every time I lost weight, I gained even =
more back.<br>
<br>
<b>THEN CAME THE CHALLENGE.</b> They said that if I lost weight and got do=
wn to my proper weight, they would give me $5,000.<br>
<br>
I wanted that money, but even more I wanted to look better and be healthy.=
 I dieted on and off for 7 months, but got nowhere. I was depressed and di=
sappointed.<br>
<br>
The $5,000 wasn't as important anymore, although I certainly wanted it. It=
 was more the overall challenge of overcoming what had become about the ha=
rdest thing I ever had to do. I suddenly realized just how difficult this =
weight problem had really become.<br>
<br>
I had researched and tried many weight loss programs during my yo-yo dieti=
ng years. I did Slim Fast, Cyber vision, soup diets, starvation, "exercise=
-and-eat-no-fat," chromium picolinate, metabolic enhancers, and more. You =
name it and I tried it. I lost some pounds with every diet, and then event=
ually gained it back, usually with a few extra pounds.<br>
<br>
I almost gave up. Then, I remembered something I heard about from a friend=
 of mine. He was using a product (some kind of special "Asian berry") his =
doctor recommended, that helped him lose a lot of weight, FAST. It had bee=
n kept a secret for years, until now. An American company hooked up with a=
n Asian scientist and brought the secret here.<br>
<br>
Hoping it might help curb my eating problem, I called him up to see how th=
e "berry" stuff (called BERRY TRIM PLUS) was working. He said it was worki=
ng "GREAT" for him, as well as for other people using it. It contains BRIN=
DALL BERRIES, and other key nutrients, which the Asian scientists found in=
 very rare plants and herbs.<br>
<br>
It sounded too good to be true, but I tried everything else. So one more t=
ime=FFFFFF85=FFFFFF85=FFFFFF85=FFFFFF85. I took Berry Trim Plus every morn=
ing; it seemed to help me "wake up" in the morning. I was hitting the snoo=
ze alarm less. I had more energy during the day, and slept better at night=
<br>
<br>
I really noticed a difference. The more I took it, the better I felt. I wa=
s staying up later, but was more refreshed in the morning. This was a very=
 different experience compared to other diets; this was a very positive th=
ing.<br>
<br>
What a feeling of accomplishment!<br>
<br>
Yes, folks, you can still eat, and even eat good stuff. If I had to eat ju=
st a salad with no dressing for a meal, I'd GO CRAZY!<br>
<br>
My husband, Sal, is shocked! IN 5 MONTHS I LOST 81 POUNDS, AND IT'S STAYIN=
G OFF! (13 months so far.) I got down to 173 pounds.<br>
<br>
It was easy. Anyone can do it. Oh, and yes, I did collect the $5,000. We m=
et my parents for a vacation. They were shocked and delighted; they didn't=
 recognize me, even when I stood right next to them. My mom and dad were g=
lad to give me the money. Dad said it was the best investment he ever made=
 and my mom, well, it took a few days for her to pick her jaw up off the f=
loor.<br>
<br>
The best reward wasn't the money. It was the reward of being healthy, and =
looking great again. I have changed, I will never be overweight again. Ber=
ry Trim Plus works incredibly.<br>
<br>
Well, now I'm the same weight I was in college, wearing denim cutoffs agai=
n. I fit in all my 20 year old clothes that I saved hoping I would fit in =
them again. I still can't believe it happened.<br>
<br>
OK, so here comes the big sales pitch, right? Look, if you want to try thi=
s product,
<u><b> your life will change after you lose the weight.</b></u> Believe me=
, this is the only thing in all the years that worked for me. With all the=
 marketing scams out there, we have to be skeptical. This is not a scam.
<b> It really works!</b><br>
<br>
Whether you need to take off five pounds or two hundred, this will help yo=
u do it,
<b> fast and easy.</b> The company has a money-back guarantee, and they ge=
t practically no returns. That says it all, if you ask me. Click on the li=
nk below and read other Berry Trim Plus testimonials to check it out. I ca=
n assure you that I would not put my credibility on the line unless everyt=
hing I have told you here were 100% true.<br>
