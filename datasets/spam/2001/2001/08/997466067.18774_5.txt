<P>Dear Friend,</P>

<P>We believe that choosing a hotel is strongly influenced by consumer emot=
ions. Obviously, consumers select a hotel because they like the price or lo=
cation. But we also know that a hotel experience, whether it's for business=
 or pleasure, will affect our moods and emotions. Our emotions may influenc=
e what hotel we will select or avoid.</P>

<P>The goal of this study is to examine what feelings contribute to the sel=
ection of a hotel. Please click this link to evaluate your most recent hote=
l stay:</P>
