means your present at the auction site. When the

bid to the agency, usually by mail. On Bid-opening date, 
bids are read publicly and awarded to the highest bidder 
who correctly followed the required procedures. 

7. What are reserve auctions?

ask the owner of item if he/she excepts the lower bid
