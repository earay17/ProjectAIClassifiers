ready website to build your business. If you have an interest in learning
more about this opportunity, simply reply to this e-mail with the words

not a requirement, if you are an outgoing person who enjoys interacting with
other professionals.

We thank you for reading this e-mail amongst all the other "junk" you find
in your In-Box every day. This is the one true offer which can give you a
lasting business of your own, and the rewards which go with it.
