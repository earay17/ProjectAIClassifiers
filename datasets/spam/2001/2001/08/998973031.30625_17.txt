<p><b>REASONS TO OWN THE STOCK!</b>

<br>

<li>PMIC just completed internal testing on their "infobar" product and is on the verge of releasing it commercially.  

This should have a HUGE impact on revenues!

<li>PMIC does sales of $8.49 per share!  Compare this to Microsoft that does sales of $4.54 per share 

and oracle with sales of $1.85 per share which shows that PMIC is truly undervalued.

<li>PMIC has had a streak of 34 profitable quarters over the last 9 years.

<li>PMIC has $3.71 Million cash on hand.

<li>PMIC has received Multi Million dollar financing from Transamerica Finance Corp, (NYSE:TFD).  

This allows PMIC to purchase with cash discounts increasing profitability.

<li>PMIC has been in business since 1989 and is one of the FASTEST growing companies in the computer software industry.  

<li>PMIC stock is currently trading around $1.00 a share and should INCREASE to $4.00 - $5.00 a share 

in the near future.
