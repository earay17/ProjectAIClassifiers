<p align="center">Noni juice considered the greatest health discovery since DNA</p>
<p align="center">Not FDA approved and not &quot;officially&quot; officially
proven to be a cure for a disease..</p>
<p align="center">For more information reply to this e-mail with the word
&quot;health&quot; in the subject line.</p>

<p align="left">The group monitored that intake Noni Juice daily have been found
to have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">These people do not reach middle age until their late 80's
    and old age well past 110</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Their hair never turns gray - they never go bald - they keep
    a full set of teeth...even into their 100's and never need hearing aids or
    glasses in their entire lives.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The women do not reach menopause until their early
    70's...while the men retain full virility and the same sexual capability at
    age 85 or even 95 as they enjoyed in their 20's and 30's</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">None of these people - not at any age - ever suffer from
    arthritis, bursitis or rheumatism.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Serious and often fatal diseases such as diabetes, cancer,
    heart attacks, strokes and Parkinson's are virtually unknown...and for this
    select group of people, lesser afflictions such as colds, viruses,
    headaches, backaches, heartburn and insomnia, simply do not exist.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Perhaps most amazing of all - they never take vitamin pills,
    minerals or any supplements whatsoever.</li>
</ul>

carefully monitored by medical science for the past number of years.&nbsp; They
come from all walks of life...reside in central Polynesia...perform the same
daily activities as the average American family - and are no different than you
and I...except for one very significant, major difference.</p>
<p align="left">They have all been directed to eat a very special kind of food
at least once a day...a food virtually unknown in any other part of the
world...a food that medical doctors in this country firmly believe is:</p>
<p align="left"><b>The world's richest source of cellular rejuvenating enzymes-
that fortify the immune system, regenerate your body's cells and actually
reverse the aging process!</b></p>
<p align="left">The name of this anti-aging, life-extending food is <font size="5"><b><u><i>NONI</i></u></b></font>,
