CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR BSII!!!

With BSII playing a major role in the food-service industry, we are expecting additional contracts similar to those announced recently with McDonalds (NYSE: MCD) and Taco Bell (NYSE: YUM).  The stock price of BSII should once again surge on hevy volume as it has done previously on the release of these outstanding news stories.

WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS BSII MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
