Dear Domain Registrant,

The dateline for .BIZ domains has been announced - Sept 17, 2001 is
the last date for early-birds to pre-register their .BIZ domains.
For .INFO domains, Sept 12, 2001 is scheduled to be the start-up date,
where all pre-registrations made earlier will be processed.

We are now accepting pre-registrations for the new top level domains with
extensions .BIZ, .INFO, .PRO, and .NAME. It is expected that over 3 million of
these new domain names will be registered in the first few minutes when
registration opens later this year. This will be the largest virtual real 
estate land grab in the history of the Internet.

According to the ZDNet July 2nd news article, industry experts have 
"estimated that 15 million dot-biz names will be registered by 2005".

If you are looking for a great name like Cars.biz or Stocks.info, be
prepared to face some stiff competition unless you pre-register early.
http://www.NewExtensionsNow.com has built the premier pre-registration engine
that can help you to secure the domain you want.  Over 500,000 names have
already been queued into our list and good names are going fast.  If your
domain name is important to you, do not wait until the last minute.  Go to
http://www.NewExtensionsNow.com to pre-register now.
