WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET THE IRS MONKEY OFF YOUR BACK?

WE  provide programs that give taxpayers a chance to pay a small amount as a
full and final settlement. 
 
An Offer is determined by the taxpayers' current financial situation, their
ability to pay as well as the value of their assets. 

 It  has a 96% acceptance rate on offers filed with the IRS.  The average
settlement amount is between 12 and 14 cents on every dollar owed. 
 
We specialize in negotiating reduced settlements and installment agreements
with the IRS on back tax liabilities, as well as preparing and filing income
taxes.  Our staff is comprised of  enrolled agents  and senior tax
consultants. 
 
What are my options if I owe $10,000 or more to the IRS? 

 You can do nothing, and wait for the IRS to garnish up to 75% of your
wages, levy your bank accounts, or  seize your home and other assets. 

 You can pay the IRS 100% of the money they say you owe them. 
 
 OR.....
 
 We can negotiate an affordable payment plan with the IRS on your behalf, so
that aggressive collection  agencies  can be avoided.
