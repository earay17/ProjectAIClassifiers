Dear Friend and Future Millionaire,

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !


BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter youhave been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.


DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT =THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: "This program has been around for a longtime but I never believed in it. But one day when 
I received this againin the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ...... 
3 weeks later the money started to come in.

First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''



 PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE 

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...

THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

Order all 5 reports shown on the list below

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE

ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.

You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computerand resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=3D$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.


------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to eachreport, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is

instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose the
majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried toput their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, and Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will notwork for you.

Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and

REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has

made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune

2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE

SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!


 Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To 
assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).

Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=3D100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500, 000 e-mails.

The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 millione-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.

The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report

# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=3D$500,000.00 (half million).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3....$5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand =
Total=3D$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

---------------------------------------------------------------



REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE

ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.

Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!


------------------------------------------------------------------


METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds

of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until theyreceive the report.

AVAILABLE REPORTS ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.



Notes:

1) Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report.

Checks NOT accepted.

2) Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper.

3) On one of those sheets of paper, Write:


1. the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering,

2. YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and

3. your name and postal address. (In case of e-mail difficulties. )
