SECURITIES HOLDING CORPORATION, INC.  (OTC: SHCI)

CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE THIS MONTH FOR SHCI!!!

THE RECENT ACQUISITION: 
The Company recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire controlling interest in Net2Trade Securities. 
They currently operate a home office in the Chicago, IL area and have two additional offices - one in California and one in Florida. 
Net2Trade is the controlling entity for Oakbrook Securities Corporation, based out of Chicago and is a NASD licensed Broker Dealer. 
There are currently 80 brokers licensed to work with the company and the firm has in excess of $200 Million under management. 

IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE ENORMOUS CHANGES, AND GROWTH POTENTIAL, 
MY ONLY QUESTION TO YOU IS: HOW DOES INDEPENDANTLY WEALTHY SOUND?

BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTC!!!
