Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTCBB: DPRI)

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE
THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!

This Thursday DPRI will be profiled by some major newsletters along with
the release of significant news regarding explosive sales for the Company.
There will be huge volume and a strong increase in price for several
days. 
The same newsletters that profiled
CERT two weeks ago will begin coverage on DPRI. They brought CERT from
$1.53 
to $4.08 in 8 days!! We know for certain that the same groups are going
to 
profile DPRI starting on Thursday.

We are very proud that we can share this information with you so that
you 
can make a profit out of it. It is highly advisable to take a position
in 
DPRI as soon as possible, today before the market closes or tomorrow.

Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have skyrocketed
600% higher this year to over $8 Million on substantial US Government
and 
Insurance Industry contracts. DPRI's client list includes over 50 major
insurance companies including Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers, Liberty
Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and Nationwide.

The stock has already bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will continue
moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily reach $4 in less
than 
a month.

Good luck and watch DPRI fly this week!
