E-Trend Networks, Inc. 

COMPANY PROFILE
E-Trend Networks is a distributor of packaged entertainment media, with distribution channels to both online retail e-commerce and traditional bricks and mortar retail outlets. The Company currently engages in "business-to-consumer"(B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and "business-to-business- to consumer"; (B2B2C) relationships and as a result acts as a facilitator, wholesaler, as well as provides third party fulfillment. E-Trend has created its online "entertainment super-site", http://www.EntertainMe.com, to capture e-commerce sales of movies, music and games and more. The products are amongst the top sales categories on the Internet. VHQ Entertainment, the founding Company of E-Trend Networks, is a public company traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol (VHQ)



OVERVIEW E Trend Networks, Inc. 
***INVESTMENT POINTS***

The Company is in the process of building a multifaceted retail empire. E-Trend has parlayed its lead in entertainment-related products to dominate other retail categories. The company has essentially doubled its online offerings in the last year, and we expect further expansion into other categories to continue at a rapid pace.

As a result of its partnership with its founding company, VHQ Entertainment, E-Trend will derive incremental business opportunities, as well as extend its corporate branding and reach, through nearly 50 VHQ Entertainment superstores. E-Trend's strategy to leverage the VHQ retail operation will include aggressive in-store marketing and cross promotions and via fulfillment of sales on the VHQ.ca web site and Internet kiosks that are planned for VHQ Entertainment stores.

Recently, E-Trend Networks enhanced its competitive and financial position, by announcing the execution of a funding commitment with an institutional investor for the purchase of up to $10 million worth of E-Trend Networks common stock. The use of proceeds will finance the acquisition of assets or businesses, as well as for general corporate purposes, such as expanding its corporate infrastructure, marketing programs and the hiring of additional key employees. At a price-to-sales-ratio that is several times less than that of its competition, as well as the overall sector, one can make a case that, at current levels, E-Trend Networks is severely undervalued.

The Company is honing in on profitability. However, minimal losses are expected for the third and fourth quarters of 2001. Moreover, positive earnings are anticipated early to mid 2002. For fiscal year 2002, we are looking for E-Trend Networks to 
report revenues of $12-14 million.

As a result of its expanding operations, E-Trend Networks expects to derive incremental economies of scale and operating 
efficiencies. Moreover, marketing, product development, and general expenses should increase, however, as a percentage of 
sales, expenses should decrease.

In summary, e-commerce is the most important retailing phenomenon to happen in our lifetimes, and E-Trend Networks, with its 
corporate partnership, niche positioning, healthy balance sheet, and adroit management team, is well positioned to weather the "dot-com" implosion. The Company has unique and sustainable competitive advantages that should allow it to stand well above its peer group.
