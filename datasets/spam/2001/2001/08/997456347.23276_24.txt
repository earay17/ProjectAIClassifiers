<P>Congratulations to subscribers who heeded our last three feature companies,

<P align=center><U>SAMARITAN PHARMECUTICALS (OTC/BB: 
SPHC)</U>   </P>
<P><U>Market News: INVESTORS SEEK SHELTER IN 
BIOTECHS</U>      </P>
<P align=center>CONSIDERED SAFE HAVEN<BR>Less short-term risk seen in sector's 
large-cap stocks </P>
<P>A barrage of bad news from technology companies has investors running for 
cover and many are finding it in the biotech sector. During the past month and a 
half, the Amex Biotech index has jumped 23%. During the same period the Toronto 
Stock Exchange's biotech subindex has moved up just 5%, ending the session 
yesterday at 2546.96. But in the context of the current market, that's not bad 
at all.</P>
<P><U>The Industry: </U>  </P>
<P>Technology stocks have been slumping in the wake of earnings warnings. As a 
result, many investors are looking elsewhere for a positive return. Lots of 
non-traditional (investors) are buying biotech shares, according to comments 
from several fund managers. This has provided the biotech companies to take 
advantage of the favorable climate and raise additional funds to progress their 
research. One of the main reasons for the phenomenon is that with its promise of 
blockbuster drugs, biotech offers similar rewards to technology stocks but, at 
least in the short term, fewer risks. Shares in biotech companies experience an 
even bigger up draft in March 2000, when technology shares began their meltdown. 
This time the bounce is less pronounced but insiders believe it may be more 
sustained. Since most biotechs are still at the development stage, industry 
analysts tend to not place a great deal of importance on the bottom line. 
Instead they focus on issues such as whether research and development targets 
are being met and the number of deals struck with major partners. </P>
<P>As often happens, most of the news driving the sector is coming out of U.S. 
based companies. Most notable company is SAMARITAN PHARMECUTICALS (OTC/BB: SPHC) 
that became the leader in very early detection of breast cancer yesterday by 
obtaining an exclusive right to the patent from Georgetown University. </P>
<P>The deal&nbsp;with Georgetown University puts SAMARITAN in the forefront of 
cancer detection procedures. Early detection breast cancer patent license by 
SAMARITAN identifies Protein (PBR) responsible for part of cellular changes in 
the development and progression of breast cancer. Eight years of extensive 
research will serve as a major breakthrough in early breast cancer detection 
saving many lives. </P>
<P>The patented procedure, entitled, "Peripheral-type Benzodiazepine Receptor is 
a tool for Detection, Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment of Human Breast 
Cancer. The procedure identifies a protein named Peripheral-type Benzodiazepine 
receptor (PBR) to be responsible for part of the changes in cellular and 
molecular functions in the development and progression of breast cancer. </P>
<P><U>Why Consider Samaritan Pharmaceuticals:</U>    </P>
<ol>
<li>Samaritan Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company focused on drug 
discovery in the key markets of Neurology, (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) Oncology 
and HIV. Samaritan's proprietary drug, Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> is scheduled to complete FDA 
Phase Ib/IIa clinical human trials for HIV this year. Samaritan has research 
collaboration with Georgetown University to develop its pipeline of innovation.<br><br>

<li>One of Samaritan's drugs, Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> is in FDA Phase 2 clinical trials for 
HIV and Samaritan hopes to submit these results to the FDA before the end of 
2001. Samaritan's Brazilian Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> clinical trial decreased the mortality rate 
of HIV patients from the norm of 60.9% to 17% over an 18-month clinical trial. 
In Samaritan's Romanian Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> clinical trial for children with AIDS, the 
government requested the placebo (sugar pill) children be put on Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> due to 
mortality concerns Samaritan has several advantages with this drug. Since there 
are over 36 million people living in the world with HIV, most of them in Africa, 
with 12 million living in the US. Samaritan's drug Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> is estimated to be 
cost about $100 per month for treatment in the US compared to the average cost 
of over $700 a month and Samaritan believes the World Bank and UN AIDS will 
embrace Anticort<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> because of its affordability where even at discounted prices 
the volume of sales would be extraordinary. <br><br>
<li>SAMARITAN PHARMACEUTICALS and 
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY signed seven-year research collaboration and licensing 
arrangement, which began on July 1, 2001. Samaritan signed this Strategic 
Alliance with Georgetown University to develop "pipeline of new technology" in 
Memory Disorders, Alzheimer's, Cancer, HIV and Parkinson's with markets over 
$300 billion. This is a very important endorsement on where Samaritan is 
heading.<br><br>
<li>As a result of Georgetown University partnership, two major news 
announcements have followed. First announcement was granting of an Exclusive 
Worldwide License for 'Early Detection' of Alzheimer's Disease Patent. This was 
followed with the announcement of Breast cancer detection drug, PBR. These drugs 
will add major revenue stream for Samaritan in the very near future.<br><br> 
<li>SAMARITAN PHARMACEUTICALS has a common stock purchase agreement with Fusion 
Capital Fund II, LLC, a Chicago-based institutional investor, whereby Fusion 
Capital agreed to buy $20 million of the Company's common stock providing the 
corporation with adequate base of financing to carry out its research.<br><br> 
<li>Strong Management: <br>The company is headed by Janet Greeson; PhD has been the Company's Chief 
Executive Officer. Dr. Greeson is a well known Psychologist and author, and has 
appeared on numerous radio and TV shows. She has been an executive in the 
healthcare business for over 25 years and founded, grew and merged over 20 
companies, which were acquired by Columbia/HCA (NYSE: COL). Dr. Vassilios 
Papadopoulos, Ph.D. has been Chief Scientific Officer and a Director of the 
Company since April 2001. Dr. Papadopoulos currently heads the Division of 
Hormone Research and is Professor of Cell Biology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience 
at Georgetown University Medical Center. Achievements by Dr. Papadopoulos 
include the Gold Medal from the City of Athens for Outstanding Performance in 
Secondary Education, Sandoz Award, Endocrine Society of Australia (1998), James 
Shannon Director's Award from NIDDK, NIK (1991-1993), and Research Career 
Development Award, NICHD, NIH (1993-1998).<br><br>
<li>Company's stock is at or about the 52 weeks low 
    making it attractive for investment. We only see an upside on this one.</li>          
               
</ol>
  <P>Happy investing. </P>
