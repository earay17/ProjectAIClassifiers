Have you ever thought or uttered the words... 

"If only I could find an easier way to make money" 

Or..."If I had more money, I could spend more time with my family, and less time at work" 

Or even...

"I sure could use more money so I could pay off all my bills once and for all" 

IT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS PROGRAM!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, its possible we haven't actually met before but you did not receive this letter by mistake, I just felt that everyone in the world deserves to know about, and should be given a chance to get in on this 
amazing program. I think every one can spare $25. Please read this letter and you will see what I'm talking about. 
Thanks so much...

Dear Friend, 

When you start to read this letter I want you to read it slowly, sit 
down, and then read it again. The first time I read this letter I didn't believe a word it said, the second time it started to set in just how much money someone can really make with this program. Well, about 5 months ago I decided to give it a try. My total investment was $110.00. That covered the five, $5 bills I sent as outlined below, and a bulk e-mailer.  From that $110 I have made over $17,000.  
That may not seem like a lot of money to some people but it sure helped
me out this year. Now you don't have to take my path your total investment can be $25 and with the reports from those listed below, they will direct you to free ad sites, the best targeted  e-mailers 
and a lot more. All in all I believe this business is the best 
one on the Internet...
Please read on.... 

Success Stories: 

Hopefully my name is still on the list. I am a retired attorney. 
Approximately, two years ago a man came to me with a letter similar to 
this one. He asked me to verify the fact that this letter was legal. I told him I would review it and get it back to him. When I first read the letter a week and a half later, we met in my office to discuss the letter. I told him that the letter he originally brought me was not 100% legal and I advised him to make a small change in the letter so it would be. 
I was still curious about the letter, so he proceeded to explain how the letter works. I thought it was a long shot and decided against 
participating. However, before my client left, I asked him to keep me 
updated as to his results. About two months later, he called to tell me 
he had received over $25,000 in cash. I did not believe him. He suggested that I try his idea and find out for myself. I thought about it for a couple of days and then I realized I had nothing to lose only some money to gain. If nothing else I would make my investment back, 
so I asked him for a copy of the letter. I followed the instructions exactly, mailed out 100,000 e-mails and sure enough, the money started
arriving. It came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more mail in than I could open in a day. After about 3 months, the money stopped coming in. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end they totaled $38,493. 
I was earning a good living as an attorney. However, as anyone in the 
legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes with the job. I told myself that if things really started working out, I could retire from my practice and play golf with in a few years. I decided to try the letter again, but this time I sent out 500,000 
e-mails. Well, three months later, my earnings totaled $69,178. 
I just couldn't believe it. I met with my old client for lunch to find out why or even how this letter was working so well. He told me that there are five names on the list instead of six and  with this program your only sending $5 to those five people instead of $10 each. 
That fact alone resulted in many more returns. The other part was guaranteeing that the whole program was legal since no one wants to risk participating in something illegal. 
I'll assume by now you are curious to know what little change I told him to make. Well, if you sent a letter like this out, to be legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that anyone sending a dollar to him must expect to receive something in return. So, when you send a dollar to each of the 5 people on the list, you must include a slip of paper with the words, "Please put my name on your mailing list"
--this is the KEY to the program! 

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOWEXACTLY, and in less than
three months you will receive over $20,000 or more! 

Instructions: 

1. Immediately send $5.00 cash to each of the five names listed below, and remember to include a note requesting that you want to be added to their mailing list. This is the step that makes this system legal... 

2. Then send $5 place between two sheets of paper.  Make sure you give 
your correct address, and email address.  Please print it legibly. 

3. Remove the name in the number five position and move each of the other names and addresses down one place -- number one becomes number two, two becomes three, three becomes four, and four becomes five Put your name and address in the first position. 

4. Start sending out e-mails with a targeted e-mail company so you can 
start receiving orders. 

5. Finally, save this letter so you can use it over and over again. 
Once again, this letter is not a chain letter, but perfectly legal way to make money. Refer to Title 18 sections 1302 and 1342 of the United 
States Postal and Lottery Laws.

Last Thoughts: 
We waste money in lotteries, enter sweepstakes and clip coupons. We need to invest in one another. Perhaps you are not in need of money. Then do it for someone else! Do it for a friend, a neighbor, college student, endowment fund,
camp, etc.    Let's help to fulfill everyone's dreams! 
Just think how much money you can make with this program, instead of just throwing
this letter away keep it, save the $25 up and invest. If everyone gets involved we can
all make our financial dreams come to life!! 
When you start receiving orders for Report #5, you will be making money quicker than ever!!  
Many say, "God has given us the knowledge to prosper", but you will only prosper when you use the knowledge. 

Thank You and Good Luck!
