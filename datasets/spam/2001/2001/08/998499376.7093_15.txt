Techie Tip - Protect your PC from hackers!       back 
It is possible for hackers to access your PC while you are online. What
the hacker can do to your PC, or with your PC, depends on many things.
But one way to prevent them from gaining access to your PC is to run a
firewall program. Currently one of the best for home use is Zone Alarm
<http://www.zonealarm.com> . It is free and easy to use. Depending on
your connection speed, the download can take awhile but well worth the
wait! The first night I ran Zone Alarm it blocked 4 possible intrusions!
Stop by www.ZoneAlarm.com <http://www.zonealarm.com>  for more info. 
Thank you!        back 
Thank you all for joining our online hunting community! And thank you
for spreading the word and helping increase the interactions on the
site! 
If you feel inclined, please add a link to our site on your personal or
company site. If you do, please let us know and as a 'thank you' we will
submit your site to the major search engines for you if you like. 
Thanks again for joining the 'Hottest' online hunting community! We all
benefit from sharing, caring and standing up for our heritage! 
See you online! Warden@HotSpotSporting.com
