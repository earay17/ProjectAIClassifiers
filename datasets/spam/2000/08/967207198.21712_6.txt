Press Release
United Ventures Group Reports Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2000
Company Reports Record Net Income
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2000--United Ventures Group, Inc. (OTC BB:UVGI - news), a premier designer, manufacturer and distributor of fine jewelry, today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2000. 
For the six months ended June 30, 2000 net sales were $5,874,404 versus $3,028,642 for the six months ended June 30, 1999. Gross profit increased from $782,494 to $1,623,622 for the first six months of 2000. Income from operations increased to $951,043 from a loss of $2,108,477. 

Net income rose to $370,749 for the six months ended June 30th compared to a loss of $3,888,619 for the comparable period in 1999. 

Isaac Nussen, President and CEO, stated, ``It is evident that during the second quarter and first six months of 2000 the Company made tremendous strides in a return to profitability. Net assets as of June 30, 2000 were $7.2 million. This coupled with our return to the OTC Bulletin Board, gaining status as a fully-reporting entity, increasing gross profit, and the commencement of an aggressive implementation of our strategic plan, we believe will garner long term shareholder value.'' 

``I look forward to the Company's announced teleconference tomorrow which will be part of the UVGI's regular reporting process and demonstrates management's efforts to keep our loyal shareholder base informed,'' Nussen concluded. 

UVGI, a Delaware Corporation, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a jewelry designer, manufacturer and distributor. The Company's product line includes a wide assortment of 14-karat gold jewelry along with the newly added diamond, pearl and platinum jewelry lines. 

The Company is currently seeking to align itself with major Internet marketing and advertising entities to increase the brand awareness and drive traffic to the site. 

This press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Expression of future goals and similar expressions reflecting something other than historical fact involve risks and uncertainties. 

The actual results the Company achieves may differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties.
