AMERICANS: Get the IRS off your BACK -- LEGALLY!
------------------------------------------------

THE SECRET the IRS is *TERRIFIED* you'll learn!

YOU OWE NO FEDERAL INCOME TAX - and never have!
Millions of Americans already have learned the
truth and have dropped OUT of the system - (the
IRS itself now admits that at least 85 MILLION
"taxpayers" are no longer filing!) - AND SO CAN
YOU!

The Federal Courts themselves, and even the US
Supreme Court have verified that it's true!
L@@K!

"Simply put, pay from a job is a 'wage', and wages
are not taxable. Congress has taxed INCOME, not
compensation (wages and salaries)." - Conner v.
U.S. 303 F Supp. 1187 (1969)

And there're MANY other cases, all of which AGREE
that the reward for your labor, wages, salaries,
and compensation for personal services (commisssions)
IS NOT, and never have been, TAXABLE!

You MUST get this FREE information! Put "NOTAX" in
the Subject Box and return this message to:

Have Great Day.
Thanks.
