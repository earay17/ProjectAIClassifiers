Special Report:
 
Canadian Insurance Industry to Compete with Banks through Regulatory Changes!
 
July, 2000

Dear Subscribers,

Welcome to another exciting Stocks on the Move Special Situation Stock Report!

To our new subscribers, please note that Stocks on the Move Special Situation Stock Reports are issued on an opt-in basis to individuals looking for a starting point, of an undervalued small cap company. We look for companies on the verge of what could potentially be groundbreaking news! We strive to bring you real quality opportunities and put forth the facts, however we stress that you do your own additional homework and render an educated investment decision. Please note that if you did not submit your name to our service, it's possible a friend or one of our affiliates has done so, if you do not wish to receive future reports simply click the UNSUBSCRIBE hyperlink below. Thank you and Good Luck!

Today we bring you a Canadian Based Insurance Company, INSURCOM FINANCIAL, IFC.A on the Canadian Venture Exchange, IRMCF on the OTC BB PS Exchange, with a full NASDAQ listing expected in the near future. The stock currently trades at approximately $1.75 US. Additionally the company has notified us that an application for a listing with Standard and Poors has recently been approved.

The opportunity here comes from pending legislation, unbeknownst to most Americans, in Canada regarding pending regulatory changes to the Canadian financial institutions industry.

In June of 1999, Paul Martin, Canadian Finance Minister, tabled legislation that could readjust the monopoly of banking services provided to Canadians. The fundamental change is one that will open the electronic payment system to life insurance companies, allowing them to perform many of the control functions the banks have over customer accounts, funds and investments. Final approval is expected no later than year's end! This could be a major windfall for Insurcom Financial and its shareholders! Additionally, an added benefit is, that while allowing Insurance companies to perform banking services, the banks cannot directly perform any traditional insurance services for 5 years!

We envision this stock trading on the NASDAQ Small Cap or National Market System by years end, with a significant street following, for the individuals who have the opportunity and risk capital to get involved now the potential returns will be staggering!

Insurcom is committed to forging relationships based on providing one-step Integrated Financial Services. Today Insurcom through its six offices, has a client base of over 40,000 clients as well as an affinity group of over 2 million Western Canadians for which an exclusive marketing agreement is in place.

This has a definitive déjà vu of the revisions to the Glass-Steagall Act which essentially removed the wall between commercial banking and investment banking, and if you recall sent banking stocks onto a sensational run. This has the makings of an explosive situation at its infancy! We urge you to look into this stock!
 
Thank you and Good Luck!
