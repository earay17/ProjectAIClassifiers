Subject: VOTED #1 Online e-Business

Dear Friend,


I thought I'd drop this quick note to let you know about an

EXCELLENT e-Commerce Business which has enjoyed rapid and

consistent growth in the last 3 years.


This is the EASIEST and the BEST online business today,  virtually

a SELF-RUN ONLINE BUSINESS. It's TWICE voted as the #1 online

business.

"I'm having 10 times the success with this business as

I did with my other ones that I've tried. I have a personal closure

rate of about 80%. And I attribute that totally to the system that

you have created. It truly is the best company out there. Since

joining in August of this year, I have been approached by 3

distributors of other companies, including 1 co-founder, but

after explaining what I do in my business and how I work the

opportunity, I guess they've given up knowing that their program

is much harder to achieve success in."
