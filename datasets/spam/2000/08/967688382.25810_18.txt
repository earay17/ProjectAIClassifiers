Hello, 

May I have your permission to send you information 
on a fully-automated online business?  One that is 
working for me and may also work for you too.  I have 
a Web site you can check out for 21 days...it is free 
and allows you to really look into the program before 
making any decisions.

Please reply with "Permission Granted" in the subject.

Thank you Very Much!
