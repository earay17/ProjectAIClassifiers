Dear Sir or Madam:

   We are researchers from the Psychology Department at the State University 
of New York at Buffalo.  We have selected individuals living in your area to 
take part in a short anonymous survey about attitudes and mood.  Although we 
know that your time is very valuable, we hope that you can spare a few 
minutes to help us with our research.

   This study involves completing an informed consent form and a short 
on-line survey that takes about 10 minutes to complete.

  If you have not participated in a psychological study before, this is a 
good opportunity to experience first hand how psychological research is 
conducted.

  If you are interested in helping us out by taking a few minutes to 
complete the on-line survey please go to http://ubsurvey5.cjb.net to find 
out more about the study.

Sincerely,


Dr. Brett Pelham
Tracy DeHart, M.A.
Mauricio Carvallo, B.A.
State University of New York at Buffalo
