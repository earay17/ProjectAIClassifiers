Dear sirs,
last april 25 th 2000, I sent you $36, to receive the CD-ROM you offered

me, containing 50 million of targeted, fresh,deliverable, e-mail
addresses. Till today I have received nothing. I could not send you
money through safe mean because you made yourselves scarce.
I hope you answer me and do not take advantage of my good faith. I hope
also to start good commercial terms with the Marketing and More by
R.Goodwin.
Please, keep your's word.
Could you be so kind to answer me by e-mail?

Yours faithfully


Giacomo Levita
