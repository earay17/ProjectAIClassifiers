Dear Friend,

Give yourself the ADVANTAGE of a new, legal, unblemished
credit file in less than 30 days, allowing you to enjoy
this New Millennium with EXCELLENT CREDIT!!

Over the past 8 years I have perfected a system called the
Proven Credit Advantage Program.  It is a guaranteed way for
legally getting an excellent credit rating almost instantly.
Here's how.

You will simply go through my easy 5 step program to quickly
get a new, legal, unblemished credit file and establish 
Excellent Credit.

Step 1-
Because no two people in the United States have the same
Social Security Number, Banks and creditors access your
credit file almost entirely by your SS#.

You will not want to change your social Security Number
because it is extremely difficult to do so and you need it
for your Employment, Taxes and Social Security Benefits.
The FEDERAL PRIVACY ACT of 1974 clearly states that only
the Government and your employer can force you to use your
SS#.  Because of this law you are allowed to legally use
another 9 digit number to use in place of your Social
Security # on credit applications.

The first day you become my client, you will receive your    
own number through the Employer Identification Number        
Program. You will need us for this because 95% of all
Employer Identification numbers, although 9 digits, do not
look anything like Social Security Numbers and cannot be
used in credit applications.  We will legally get you an 
Employer Identification Number that fits in the same range
of Social Numbers in use today.  Because the Federal Laws
do not require you to give your SS# to anyone besides your
Employer and the Government, you can now legally use this
number in place of your SS# on credit applications.       
Remember, your new number will only be used for new credit.

Step 2-
No two people with the same name have the same mailing
address, so you will need to obtain a new mailing address
for use on your new credit files.  A friend, relative or
mailbox address in your area will be perfect.

Step 3-
No two people with the same name have the same telephone 
numbers, so you will also need a new telephone number for
use on your new credit file.  A friend, relative, voice
mail or pager will work again perfectly.

Step 4-
With your new Social Security number, new address and new
telephone number we will open yor new credit file.  It will
now be totally impossible for any creditor to know anything
about your past credit history.

Step 5-
To guarantee that you will quickly qualify for credit again,
we will assist you in instantly adding positive information
to your new credit file.  This is an unknown way of adding
real accounts to your new credit file to give you an
Excellent Credit Rating in less than 30 days.  As you know,
the more positive information on your credit file, the more
money banks will lend you.

Many of our clients have credit lines over $100,000 because
of our Proven Credit Advantage Program!

When we are finished you will have a copy of your new,       
legal, unblemished credit file proving that you now have
excellent credit again.  This will take less than 30 days.      
You will now be able to easily qualify for credit!

your name, complete mailing address inlcuding zip code and
telephone number (optional), along with a check or money    
order made payable to - Lion S -  for $29.00.  The information you
