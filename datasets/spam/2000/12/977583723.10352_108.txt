A am selling perfectly working copies  of Microsoft Office 2000

and includes:

Word 
Excel 
Outlook

Premium

If you are would like to order, please email me. I accept 
checks,money
orders, and PayPal(Allows use of creditcards with 3% surcharge.) 
The
software are virus checked and copied correctly with the best

hardware available. In other words, they work flawlessly. CDR's 
as you
know cost very little and there is little reason for me to rip 
you off.
The highest cost is the time and effort I spent in defeating the 
copy
protection system properly. I will definitely send the software 
upon
