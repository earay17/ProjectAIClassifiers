BOY MEETS GIRL

Strolling through a night club, Adam spotted a lovely young woman
sitting alone at a table, and walked over.

"Say, beautiful, how about coming along and giving me a sweet kiss?"

The woman looked up. "That'll be the day."

"Well then," he said, "how about coming along to my apartment and
getting busy?"

Snickering, the woman said, "That'll be the day!"

"Okay," said Adam. "How about taking my limo to my private
jet, flying to Hawaii, and spending the weekend on my private
beach?"

The woman said, "This'll be the day."

STAYING AFLOAT

There was a competition to cross the English Channel doing only the
breaststroke. Just three women entered the race: a brunette, a
redhead, and a blonde.

After approximately 14 hours the brunette staggered up on the shore
and was declared the fastest breaststroker.

About 40 minutes later the redhead crawled up on the shore and was
declared to be the second place finisher.

Nearly 48 hours after that, the blonde finally came ashore and
promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers.

When the reporters asked why it took her so long to complete the
race, she replied, "I don't want to sound like I'm a sore loser,
but I think those two other girls were using their arms."
