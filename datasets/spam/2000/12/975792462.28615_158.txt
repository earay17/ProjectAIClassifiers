My wife and I are trying to get our new website up and running.  
It is a complete shopping mall.  It also has a wonderful online travel 
agency.  Would you please visit
Http://www.onlinebuys.org

at least once.  --or better yet bookmark it and use it for all your 
travel and shopping needs.

God Bless,


Justin & Nicole Krauss
