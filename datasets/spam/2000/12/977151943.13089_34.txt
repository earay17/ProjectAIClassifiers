Dear Sirs,

Times in shipping and transportation are changing, development is
unpredictable fast and the past or current means to do business may not be
the same in the future: The maritime and transport industry is facing
e-commerce.

Since May this year, GloMaP.com of Hamburg, Germany is offering with
www.glomap.com an online marketplace and seafreight exchange for all parties
in the maritime chartering and transportation industry. GloMaP.com is
changing the landscape in which traditional shipping and transportation
business is done: Trading of cargoes / shipments in an online environment.
Within the first few months of GloMaP, already some 1.800 customers
registered with GloMaP.com, some 800 cargoes were placed on www.glomap.com
and carriers?, agents? and brokers? quotations and bids were given for more
than 60% of all the cargoes shown on www.glomap.com. In this very moment,
there are some 2.300 TEU, some 220.000 mt and 15.000 cbm of bulk cargoes
placed on the platform.

All parties in shipping and transportation - such as Shipowners, Shipbrokers
and Agents, Freight Forwarders, Importers and Exporters - can conduct
business in form of auctions, tenders, transactions and negotiations through
the Internet and GloMaP.com. Shippers can indicate their needs for
shipments, the potential movements of cargoes from and to with all details
necessary for the tender allowing the carrying side to bid for the
respective cargoes within a certain time period set by the shipper.

GloMaP.com is an additional sales channel for all parties. The GloMaP.com
exchange www.glomap.com offers a cometogether and the fixing of main terms.
It is a very convenient and efficient way to conduct further business. The
advantage of an global market place like www.glomap.com is its global
approach: Parties working on www.glomap.com do benefit from the creation of
new international relationships. And additionally: GloMaP.com is simply
saving and reducing the working time of the employees engaged in the booking
process. And with the possibility to set preferences, carriers have a
valuable chance to customize the GloMaP.com-system following their specific
needs.

Registration is free of charge and without any obligation. There are no
access or membership fees and no additional software is necessary.

GloMaP.com is an open and unbiased market connecting businesses all over the
world. GloMaP.com is not owned or associated with any shipping line, broker,
forwarder or manufacturer and is, therefore, in a position to act
independently maximizing the benefits for all parties involved.

To see for yourself whether GloMap.com can be beneficial for your business,
we kindly ask you to have a look at www.glomap.com. Access to the
marketplace will be given to all parties once they register - again,
registration is without any obligation on your part and free of charge.

If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contact us via email
at contact@glomap.com or call us under
+ 49 40 46 00 48 - 0.

Yours faithfully
GloMaP.com
