Dear Friend,

Remember the first time you built a web site?
You spent weeks, perhaps months on it.  It was your 
masterpiece.
You showed it to all of your family and friends and everyone 
loved it.
THE WORLD WAS GOOD!
Then you ran out of people to show it to.  It was time to start the 
“Internet Marketing” that you had heard so much about.

You surfed the net and found tons of web sites that offered free 
submissions to 
Free for All Link Pages and free classified sites.  “This is easy”, 
you thought as 
You went to bed dreaming of all the visitors your web site would 
have.
They would be impressed with your site, and buy your product.  
You
couldn’t understand what all the fuss was about, people 
everywhere were 
complaining about not getting any traffic to their sites and in one 
night  
You had outsmarted them all and placed your web site in 
thousands of 
sites with just a few clicks.

Then NOTHING happened!

Your traffic counters didn’t move.
Your orders didn’t sail in.
No one was sending you inquiries about your product or 
services.

So…
You returned to the secret sites that you had bookmarked, and 
submitted your site a few more times.  Still NOTHING 
happened.

Then….
Then, as you surfed the web for more free places to list your site 
you noticed little blurbs about search engines.  You had heard 
the warnings from the FFA and classified sites about them so 
you didn’t think much about them.  Besides, the other promotion 
sites PROMISED thousands of hits daily.

And you BELIEVED them!

So you waited, weeks and months passed again, still 
NOTHING!

Finally, you realized that search engines just might be the answer.

You found some search engines and submitted your web site to 
them. 
 “AH!” you thought, “Now they will come.”  You knew that 
search 
engines could take weeks to list you, so you waited patiently.  
You 
were confident your site would be recognized by the engine 
owners 
as a masterpiece and would get top placement.

Again weeks and months went by. NOTHING!
You checked your URL to see if it was listed.  NOTHING!
You even typed in your own name to see if it would come up.  
NOTHING!

WELCOME TO SEARCH ENGINE HELL!

You don’t work the Internet, it works you.
You can’t even get listed in any the search engines.
You slaved over your web site only to see it ranked last.
You hired a webmaster thinking he was the answer to your 
problems.
You still can’t get in the top 20 of ANY search engine.
You thought that putting up a web site was all that you had to do.
You thought that they were kidding when you heard 
      that web site promotion was a full time job.
You just don’t have the time or knowledge to get a better 
placement.

This is where most people give up.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO!!!

thousands of hits that some with it.

FOR EXAMPLE:

Infoseek, Alta Vista and HotBot ban websites that break their 
rules (many of the ‘insider’ techniques so called “Experts: will 
recommend will get you banned faster than you can imagine.
Many search engines limit the number of pages you can submit 
from your domain. (some only allow one in order to get the best 
results)  We can show you techniques we use to get hundreds of 
our pages listed.
Yahoo only lists about 1% of the web in their actual directory.  
In order to get listed, you may have to use the “BACKDOOR.”
Using so-called search engine submission software that submits 
your site to 1000 or more search engines could actually get your 
page deleted from the major search engines.
Choosing the most effective “keywords” is one of the major 
keys to a successful website submission.  Pick the right ones and 
your site will look like grand central station during rush hour.
95% of Internet traffic originates at one of the 10 major search 
engines… If you[‘re not listed you might as well not even have a 
website.

It has takes us over 2 years to learn how to place any type of 
website in the top 10 consistently.

Normally we charge $750 for three keywords that you want top 
ranking on (plus a monthly fee of $150 for keeping that rank.)
