         							   And Much, Much More!!



			GUARANTEED RESULTS!!

Our entire course includes 3 programs that are very easy to use, and the 
results are guaranteed!!




The Science Of Debt Elimination......... Give you Proven strategies to 
completely eliminate all your debt, including your mortgage, using nothing more than 
your present income and with out sacrificing your lifestyle.
It shows you step by step how to “rate” your debts in the order of payment so you 
can start enjoying a life with out debt in the soonest possible time.


The art of Prosperous Living.............. Gives you specific strategies to ensure a 
financially secure future. A million dollar retirement is possible even on a “below 
average” income. You’ll also learn how to increase your monthly income and keep 
more of the money you make to use for yourself and family rather than paying it out 
on bills and taxes.



The Free Money System............ A bonus which is given to you absolutely free of 
charge with the use of the above course that shows you how to immediately lower 
some or all of your current monthly payments by as much as 85% and more using 0% 
financing. You’ll never pay interest again, and unlike traditional “bill consolidation” 
and “refinancing” The Free Money System does not require any fees or closing costs 
of any kind. Furthermore, you cannot be turned down!!!!!



IMAGINE LIFE WITH.......

NO house payments!!!
NO car payments!!!
NO credit car payments!!!
NO lease payments!!!
NO Loan Payments!!!
........NO FINANCIAL STRESS!!!!


HOW DOES IT FEEL.....to be misled and taken advantage of by the big financial 
lenders of this country? Did you know......After paying 5 years on a 30 year, 
$100,000 mortgage at 9%, you will have paid your lender $48,277.36 and reduced 
your loan balance just $4,119.66. After more than 23 years, you will have paid over 
$222,800.00 ( not including taxes and insurance ) and have only paid off half your 
loan!

> A $2000 credit card balance can take over 12 years and more than $10,000.00 to 
pay off, and a $5,000 balance can take over 40 years and $34,953.84 to pay off 
making the lenders recommended minimum payment.

> We’ve been misled to believe such things as “ refinancing” and “consolidated loans” 
are in our best interest. You get a lower monthly payment, but besides the money you 
pay-up front in closing costs, you can end up paying over 150% more in interest over 
time. Think about it, the mortgage lender has you locked into a higher interest rate for 
a number of years, and if you don’t pay, they simply take your home through 
foreclosure. So why would they offer you a lower rate unless it was to their benefit? 
Creditors are not “nice” people or “charities” - they refinance loans because it 
financially helps them-not you!!! THE TERM “ LOW INTEREST” IS A LIE!! A 
30 year, $100,000 mortgage at just 6% is considered incredibly low, but you’ll still 
pay almost $72,000.00 in interest charges alone in just the first 10 years! No 
interest and 0% financing is the only way you’ll truly come out a winner!!

IMMEDIATELY LOWER YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS!!!


SAVINGS: How would you like to “refinance” your home (without any fees or 
closing costs of kind ) to a 0% mortgage? On a 30 year, $100,000 mortgage at 9% 
interest, you would pay $804.62 per month and $189,663 in interest alone!! With 
The Free Money System, your payments would be just $277.78 per month rather 
than $804.62 which gives you a lot more spendable income each and every month, 
and you would pay absolutely zero interest!!

FLEXIBILITY: With the Free Money System, you have the flexibility to pay any 
amount you want, any time you want, and even skip payments ( for months or even 
years ) without any penalties, fees, or some mortgage lender threatening to foreclose 
on your home!! This can be especially helpful when you need extra money for 
holidays, vacations, etc.

EFFECTIVENESS: The Free Money System works for all types of debt. 
Mortgages, car loans, student loans, charge cards, boat loans- you name it! You can 
“consolidate” and “refinance” your existing bills as well as finance new purchases with 
0% interest!

SIMPLICITY: There are no cost, up-front fees, down payments, security deposits, 
or anything else required. There are no loan applications to fill out or qualifications 
you have to meet to be “eligible” to receive interest free money. You cannot be turned 
down! 

INCOME: You’ll even learn how to increase your current income by borrowing 
money at 0% interest and simply depositing the money into a saving account at a bank 
to earn interest, and much more!





Here’s an example of an average families monthly savings...........:

Your Current Monthly payments:        

7% Mortgage                  $997.95                       
10% Auto Loan              $463.15                       
11% Bank Loan              $688.75                       
14% Credit Card             $155.27	        
18% Credit Card             $237.88	       

TOTALS                     $2,543.00	                   


With The Free Money System:

7% Mortgage                          $416.67
10% Auto Loan                      $347.23
11% Bank Loan                      $416.67
14% Credit Card                    $83.34
18% Credit Card                    $97.23

TOTALS                            $1,361.14 



Monthly Savings:

7% Mortgage           	         $581.28
10% Auto Loan        	         $115.92
11% Bank Loan                 $272.08
14% Credit Card                $71.93 
18% Credit Card                $140.65

TOTALS                          $1,181.86


OVER $1 MILLION DOLLARS PLUS $600.00 PER MONTHLY EXTRA 
ALL WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN INCOME! Did you know if you look just 
the savings from the mortgage payment in this example ( $581.28 ) and invested it 
into a mutual fund with a “below average” rate of return - you would accumulate over 
$1 million dollars in the same 30 years with the same money as it would have taken 
you just to pay-off the mortgage! That would make retirement, even “early” 
retirement a lot more fun- would it?
Plus, you would have just over $600.00 of extra spendable income each and every 
month ( $1181.86 less $581.28 invested ) to enjoy, and again, your income and 
lifestyle have remained the same. The big difference is that you’re using this course to 
change who ends up with YOUR money.






ADJUST THE NUMBERS..... up or down to fit your budget, but either way you 
can’t beat 0% interest! No matter how much you earn or how much you owe, this 
course will work for you. It’s not magic, you’ll learn proven strategies that will 
guarantee a debt free life and a financially secure future- period! You can be living a 
life of complete financial freedom within just a few years using nothing but the money 
you’re already earning. Imagine NO house payment, NO car payment, No loan 
payments, No financial stress!

ASK YOURSELF......Who actually “owns” your house? Who actually “owns” car? 
Are You walking on financed carpet or sitting on financed furniture? Are you making 
credit card payments that you can no longer remember what you purchased with 
them? Imagine, in just a few short years you can be rid of all these payments, 
including your mortgage payment, without cutting back on your lifestyle and with out 
the need to increase your income. A life with out debt is more enjoyable, there’s less 
stress and more money to enjoy- and the results are guaranteed.

SOUND UNBELIEVABLE?????

Much of this information may sound impossible, but that’s because our society has 
been conditioned by billions and billions of dollars in advertising teaching us how to 
spend tomorrow’s money today with credit! We’ve been led to believe that debt is a 
necessity, and a normal part of life. It’s not, and this course will show you how to 
easily eliminate debt and stay out of debt forever! You’ll understand how you can 
afford even big purchases like a new car with out the need for financing!

ARE YOU MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING BIG???

If hundreds of thousands of other people are using this course to become 100% debt 
free, and if they’re NOT having to pay hundreds, even thousands of dollars in monthly 
interest payments- then why should you? IT WOULD BE A SHAME......for you to 
make 1 more unnecessary interest payment, and for far less than the interest you’ll 
probably spend in just a single month, you could have this course working for you and 
your family. If you care about your financial future, and that of your loved ones, you 
need to order this course TODAY! Not tomorrow! Not next week! Not next month, 
because every day you don’t have this course working for you- compound interest is 
working against you, and it’s costing you money! Once that money is lost in interest 
payments to your creditors- you can never get it back!


THE CREDIT CRUTCH! If you’re one of the 97% of Americans who have been 
hooked on credit for so long that you simply don’t know how to live or survive with 
out it, then you need to throw away your “credit crutch!” Don’t be like those people 
who think debt is just a normal part of life- it isn’t! I’m sure that you’ve had the feeling 
that if you could just get out from under “those monthly payments” things would be 
different. Well, the course in front of you is the vehicle you need to change the things 
you want to change and obtain complete financial freedom for you and your family.

LET US PROVE IT WITH A 100% GUARANTEE AND A FREE GIFT!!

grocery savings off your food budget, but obviously, the real benefits come from using 
the course, and remember, the results are guaranteed! IT”S UP TO YOU! You can 
continue making interest payments when you don’t have to, make your creditors rich 
at the expense of your financial future, or you can become totally debt free in just a 
few short years, including your mortgage, with nothing more than the money you 
already bring home. Immediately lower your monthly payments by “consolidating” 
and “refinancing” with 0% interest at no cost, and then build a financially secure
