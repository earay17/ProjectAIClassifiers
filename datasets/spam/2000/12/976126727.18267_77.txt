EASTERN HERBAL HEALTH FOOD FOR CURING CHRONIC DIABETES

Hello bruceg, 
	There is a great news for you and/or for your friends.
	A senior medical doctor, rather a University professor, with PHD degree in modern internal 
medicine and a Korean agricultural expert, also with a doctorate degree, have jointly written two popular 
books during the last 2, 3 years showing the effectiveness of a medicine based on silk worm to treat 
chronic diabetes.  Thousands of sugar patients have published their experiences of getting well by taking 
this medicine for a period of about 3 to 6 months.  There are large amounts of orders for it. It has grown 
very popular among the sugar patients. 	
	The distributors of this health food are working 7 days a week, 24-hours a day, for dispatching 
this medicine by post parcel to the patients all over Japan. It is prepared by the silk worm, which is mostly 
imported from Korea.  But it is processed in Japan as a health food for energy. This can be taken together 
with the prescription of the Doctor, as it is more a health food than a medicine.
	The side benefits of this health food are also effective for constipation and other old-age 
diseases like high blood pressure and loss of energy etc. as well. If interested please contact me at the 
above email address.
	One bottle of tablets, for using one month, 3 tablets 3 times a day, will cost you $200.00 
including postal charges. Health is more important than $200/- a month for about 6 months.  Payments can 
be accepted through all major American or other credit cards. 
	I am also using it and have found it very effective for myself.
	Please send me email, if interested. 
	Regards.

	Hussain Khan, M.A. (Tokyo University)
