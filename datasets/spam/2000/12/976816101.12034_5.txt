Dear Friend:
 
Do you need a change in your life?
 
Do you remember when the entire world seemed like it was
yours for the taking?
 
Do you remember a time when all of your hopes and dreams seemed
like they were attainable?
 
First of all, let's be honest. You are not going to earn $50,000 in 20 days.
It just isn't going to happen. Anyone who tells you that you can, is not
being truthful.
****************************************************************************
********************
I would like to tell you about a plan though, that has changed my life. Take
a calculator and figure in the worst possible scenario. Decide for yourself.
If you decide that you want to take control of your life and move
forward...that is your decision.
****************************************************************************
********************
Here's the step by step plan summary.
 
1)You order the 4 reports listed below ($5 each). They come to you by email.
2) Save a copy of this entire letter and put your name at report #1. Move
all other
 names  down. (You will be removing the person at the level 4)
3) Use any of the hundreds of bulk email services out there.
4) Orders will come right to your door. Simply email them the report they
ordered.
Isn't that about as easy as it gets???
****************************************************************************
**********************
Your cost to participate in this program is practically nothing
(surely you can afford $20 and initial bulk mailing cost). You obviously
 already have a computer and an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!
 
The primary method of building your downline is bulk email.
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.
 Let's assume that you and all those involved email out only
2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response.
The response could be much better. Also, many people will email out more
than 2,000
programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for Report #1.  Those
10 respond
 by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000.  Out of those
0.5%, 100 people
respond and order 20,000.  The 0.5% response rate to that is 1,000 orders
for Report #3.
Those 1,000 send out 2,000 each for a total of 2,000,000.  The 0.5% response
rate is 10,000 
orders for report #4. That is 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!!
****************************************************************************
***************************
Your total income in this example is: $50+ $500+ $5000+ $50,000 for a total
of $55,550!!!
****************************************************************************
***************************
 
REMEMBER FRIEND. THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL
TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!!!  DARE TO THINK
FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR EVEN HALF MAILED OUT
100,000 INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe, most people will do just that, and
more!!!
 
Friend, you do the math. You look at the opportunity, if you decide that you
would like to
 participate in this program, the decision is yours.
 
Recently, the Federal Trade Commisison has tried to stop chain letters
which promise you will make tons of money by participating.  Such
chain letters are NOT legal because of this reason. This new program
complies with all the rules.
 
To be legal, a chain letter must offer a product and must not promise you
 will get rich by taking part. If you look at the program, do the math and
decide that you will make money, it is your opinion. No such claim is here.
However, I do strongly encourage you to do the calculations.
Figure out the worst possible response and see how it calculates.
 
Your orders come right to your door and you send your reports via email. You
are not involved 
in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office.
This is the EASIEST
 plan anywhere. It is simply order filling by email.
Order the four reports shown on the list below. You can't sell them if you
don't order them!!!.
 
For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the  NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING, YOUR 
EMAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME AND RETURN ADDRESS (in case there's a problem).
MAKE SURE YOUR 
RETURN ADDRESS IS ON THE ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!
 
Report #1 will tell you how to download bulk email software and email
addresses
 so you can send it out to thousands while you sleep. Remember that 50,000+
 new people are joining the internet every month.
 
By the way, there are over 50 million email addresses with millions more
joining the
internet each year, so we don't worry about "saturation".  People are used
to seeing and hearing
the same advertisements every day on radio/TV.  How often have you received
the same pizza flyers
on your door. Then, one day you are hungry for pizza and immediately recall
the flyer. Same thing
 with this letter. I received this letter many times- then one day I decided
it was time to try it.
 
This program will not require you to come into contact with people or take
any
telephone calls. Just follow the instructions.
 
There is no guarantee either stated or implied that anyone participating in
this program 
will earn $50,000+.  (You must include that statement to make this legal.)
 
* Always offer same day service! Email reports the day that you receive the
order!!  
This will guarentee that the e-mail that THEY send out with YOUR name and
address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!
****************************************************************************
*************************
Get started TODAY!! Notes- ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (US CURRENCY) FOR EACH
REPORT.  
CHECKS or MONEY ORDERS NOT ACCEPTED, AND PLEASE NO FOREIGN CURRENCY.  Make
sure the cash is 
concealed by wrapping it in two sheets of paper. On one of those sheets
write: 
(a) the number and name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail
address, 
and (c) your name and postal address.
