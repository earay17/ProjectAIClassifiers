How to make $1,000,000 in 20 weeks by selling to newcomers on the net!

Every month over 1,000,000 new web sites come on-line. Websites from people who want to make a living from Internet commerce. 

But they haven't got the slightest idea how to go about it. 

Would you like to be able to get a list of these people? Newcomers to the Net are ideal prospects for anyone offering Internet Marketing services and training of any kind. 

Would you like to get the tools to trace them, take them by the hand, and sell them your unique Internet marketing program? 

These newbies will welcome your offer with outstretched arms! (Remember your own desperation when you entered the net??) 

Imagine! You can offer them a free manual that provides the step-by-step information they have been searching forever since they came on line, when they buy the necessary software to become successful from you. 

Do you think you'll have any problems selling to these people??? 

When you realize that newcomers to the Internet want and need your help, it should be clear that here is the answer to all of your promotion fantasies! Here is the Mother lode! The source of more business than you ever dreamed of! If you could reach these people, it would be almost like getting the combination to your bank's safe! 

The question is though, how do you find these people? 

There is no main gate to the Internet that everyone goes through when they first get online... There's no "newbie" lounge where they all congregate... or is there? 

In fact, there is a place where most Internet newcomers gather, if they are hoping to establish a web-based home business. 

You can find them there any time of the day or night... I can show you where they are! 

None of the Internet Marketing Gurus has ever been able to tell you where to catch these people when they're entering the net! I can and I will! 

If you would like to reach these people, I'll be glad to show you how you can. But, I will not waste my time to teach anybody who is not motivated enough to become a millionaire in 20 weeks, by selling to these newcomers on the net. 

I want your commitment for a couple of hours per day for 20 weeks. I want you to do EXACTLY what I tell you to do - nothing more, nothing less. If you can discipline yourself enough for that period of time, you will be rewarded with the greatest wealth you've ever dreamed of. 

I'm NOT going to share my unique information with every Tom, Dick or Harry. I want to keep this EXCLUSIVE to a selected number dedicated wealth creators. 

If you Act NOW...it's absolutely FREE!  It normally costs $99.95 but for now I am just giving it away to introduce our new InfoShare Web Marketing concept! You will have access to our 32-page FREE booklet "Inside Secrets to Wealth on the Web" that will explain most of the details. 

You've got to send me an email first to show me that you are serious about this. I will then send you a 32 page FREE booklet that will explain most of the details. You can read it first and then decide whether you are motivated enough to become a millionaire within 20 weeks. 

If you are dedicated enough, please send an email (Reply) with "booklet" in the subject field to:  kenlt@mail.com 

Don't waste your time any further on other so-called "money making" programs. I offer you the opportunity to become a millionaire in 20 weeks by selling to the newcomers on the Internet - the easiest market on earth. But you have to have the desire to become rich and be prepared to do exactly what I'll tell you to do. 

For a limited time only, get the bonus CD -  "The Ultimate Package" which contains invaluable information to any consumer! This is worth over $100 but for now, can be yours FREE! This CD contains a multitude of reports, free software, and links to information that everybody should have. For details about this CD or how to get it, just send an email (Reply) with "booklet" in the subject field to:  kenlt@mail.com

I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards, 

Ken Turner
