Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you=
<BR>
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this =
letter<BR>
on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted anentire =
show<BR>
to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really =
can<BR>
make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program w=
as<BR>
legal.<BR>
<BR>
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws=
<BR>
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can "follow the=
<BR>
simple instruction" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 o=
ut of<BR>
pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PRO=
GRAM<BR>
HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN<BR>
EVER.<BR>
<BR>
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity". I =
was<BR>
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I<=
BR>
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal=
<BR>
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $ 610,47=
0.00<BR>
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jers=

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORD=

<BR>
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from=

send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads =
and<BR>
much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:<BR>
<BR>
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

<BR>
<BR>
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we<=
BR>
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's=
 also<BR>
assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the res=
ponse<BR>
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people =
will<BR>
send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Contin=
uing<BR>
with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.<BR>
<BR>
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 peop=
le<BR>
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of t=
hose<BR>
50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=3D100 people respon=
ded and<BR>
ordered Report # 2.<BR>
<BR>
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mail=
s. The<BR>
0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.<BR>
<BR>
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million<BR>
e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.<BR>
<BR>
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 =
(50<BR>
million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #=
 5<BR>
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH =3D $500,000.00 (half a million dollar=
s).<BR>
<BR>
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....<BR=
>
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=3D$555,550.00<BR=
>
<BR>
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE=
<BR>
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF=
<BR>
MONEY!<BR>

<BR>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU=
<BR>
MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or hal=
f or<BR>
even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There ar=
e over<BR>
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands =
more<BR>
coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and m=

<BR>
<BR>
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of=
 FREE<BR>
places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily=
 get a<BR>
larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add MET=
HOD #<BR>
2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail the=
m the<BR>
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all ord=
ers.<BR>
<BR>
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and<BR>
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they<BR=

receive the report.<BR>
