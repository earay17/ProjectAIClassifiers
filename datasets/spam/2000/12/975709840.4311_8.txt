How to make $1,000,000 in 20 weeks by selling to newcomers on the net
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Every month over 1,000,000 new web-sites come on-line. Websites 
from people who want to make a living from internet commerce. 

But they haven't got the slightest idea how to go about it. 

Would you like to be able to get a list of these people? 
Newcomers to the Net are ideal prospects for anyone offering 
Internet Marketing services and training of any kind. Would you 
like to get the tools to trace them, take them by the hand, and 
sell them your unique internet marketing program? 

These newbies will welcome your offer with outstretched arms! 
(Remember your own desperation when you entered the net??) 

Imagine! You can offer them a free manual that provides the 
step-by-step information they have been searching for ever since
they came on line, when they buy the necessary software to become
successful from you. 

Do you think you'll have any problems selling to these people??? 

When you realize that newcomers to the Internet want and need 
your help, it should be clear that here is the answer to all of 
your promotion fantasies! Here is the Mother-lode! The source of
more business than you ever dreamed of! If you could reach these
people, it would be almost like getting the combination to your 
bank's safe! 

The question is though, how do you find these people? 

There is no main gate to the Internet, that everyone goes through
when they first get online... There's no "newbie" lounge where 
they all congregate... or is there? 

In fact, there is a place where most Internet newcomers gather, 
if they are hoping to establish a web-based home business. You c
an find them there any time of the day or night... I can show you
where they are! 

None of the internet Marketing Gurus has ever been able to tell 
you where to catch these people when they're entering the net! I
can and I will! 

If you would like to reach these people, I'll be glad to show you
how you can. But, I will not waste my time to teach anybody who 
is not motivated enough to become a millionair in 20 weeks, by 
selling to these newcomers on the net. 

I want your commitment for a couple of hours per day for 20 
weeks. I want you to do EXACTLY what I tell you to do - nothing 
more, nothing less. If you can dicipline yourself enough for that
period of time, you will be rewarded with the greatest wealth 
you've ever dreamed of. 

I'm NOT going to share my unique information with every Tom, Dick
or Harry. I want to keep this EXCLUSIVE to a selected number 
dedicated wealth creators. 

You've got to send me an email first to show me that you are 
serious about this. I will then send you a 30 page FREE booklet 
that will explain most of the the details. You can read it first 
and then decide whether you are motivated enough to become a 
millionaire within 20 weeks. 

If you are dedicated enough, please send an email with "booklet"
in the subject field to 
mailto:wealthmail@ bigfoot.com?subject=booklet 

Don't waste your time any further on other so called "money 
making" programs. I offer you the opportunity to become a 
millionaire in 20 weeks by selling to the newcomers on the 
internet. The easiest market on earth. But you have to have the 
desire to become rich and be prepared to do exactly what I'll 
tell you to do. 

I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. 

Best regards
Andrew
