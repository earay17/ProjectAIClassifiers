        Parents of 15 year old find $71,000 in CASH in closet!

   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$


   Does this headline look familiar?  Of course it does.  You most likely have just 
   seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).

   His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across 
   a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes 
   and a skateboard in the back of her son's closet.  Nothing could have prepared 
   her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of 
   cash.  Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds- all neatly rubber-banded 
   in labeled piles.  

   My first thought was that he had robbed a bank, says the 41-year-old 
   woman.  There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag - that's more than my 
   husband earns in a year!

   The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he 
   worked to tell him what she'd discovered.  He came home right away and they 
   drove together to the boy's school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect 
   that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it 
   in the closet.

   As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the Internet a type 
   of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off of the Internet.  
   Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on 
   his computer in his bedroom.

   "I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it 
   like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.

   The E-mail letter listed 3 addresses and contained instructions to send three 
   $5 dollar bills to the people on the list, then delete the top address and move 
    the other 2 addresses up, and finally to add your name to the bottom of the list. 
   

   The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in 
   $5 dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the 
   bottom of the 3-address list "I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't 
   think it was going to work", the boy continues.

   Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that 
   his parents had gotten for his video-game magazine subscriptions began 
   to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. "About 
   a week later I rode (my bike) down to the post office and my box had 1 
   magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it.  There was a yellow slip 
   that said I had to go up to the (post office) counter - I thought I was in trouble 
   or something (laughs)".  He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had 
   a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my 
   backpack 'cause I couldn't carry it all". 

   Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.  "The money 
   just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, I barely 
   had time for my homework".  He had also been riding his bike to several of the 
   area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. 
   "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with 
   like five thousand at a time in my backpack.   I would usually tell the lady at the 
   bank counter that my dad had sent me in (to exchange the money) and he was 
   outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
   told me that she wouldn't be able to do it for me and my dad would have to 
   come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)".

   Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.  The reporting news 
   team examined and investigated the so-called 'chain-letter' the boy was sending 
   out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal 
   according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, 
   or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, 
   Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which states a product or service must be 
   exchanged for money received.

   Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "Please 
   add me to your mailing list".  This simple note made the letter legal because 
   he was exchanging a service (adding the purchasers name to his mailing list) 
   for a five-dollar fee.  Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by 
   E-mail, you could do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following 
   the instructions in the letter.

   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$

   Here are instructions on how to make $10,000 US cash in the next 2 weeks:

   There are 3 addresses listed below.

   Send the three people on the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to 
   securely hide it), along with a note that says:  "Please add me to your list".

   Then delete the top name, move the other 2 up and put your name at the 
   bottom.

   Now start sending this ENTIRE E-mail back out to everyone you know.  
   When 20 people receive it, those 20 people will send you $5 and move 
   your name up to the middle position and they will each send out 20 emails. 
   That totals 400 people that will receive this letter with your name in the 
   middle.  Then, those 400 people will send you $5 and move your name to 
   the top!

   HERE IS WHERE IT GET'S VERY INTERSTING!

   When 400 people email it to 20 others, 8,000 will receive the email with your 
   name at the top! 8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill = $40,000 cash. 
   That's if everyone responds to this E-mail, but not everyone will, so you 
   can expect more realistically to receive about $10,000 cash $5 bills in 
   your mailbox.  But some of you may receive A WHOLE LOT MORE!

   This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but send 
   only a US CASH $5 bill.

   The more e-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive.  If each 
   person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people that receive 
   this letter when your name reaches the top. If only 1% of those people 
   respond, you will get $50,000 cash.

   Here is the list:

   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$

   1) MP Chior
        310 N Springboro Pk
        Dayton, Oh 45449

   2) T Klemitski
        2312 Lafayette Dr
        Heath, TX 75032

   3) M Vord 
       1628 Silverlake 
       Centerville, Oh 45458


   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$   $$$

   THERES'S NOTHING MORE TO DO!  When your email reaches others.  You 
   will start receiving $5 bills from people just like yourself, who are willing to 
   invest three $5 bills to receive $10,000 or more in cash!

   So get started right away!  Put your name at the bottom, send the three people 
   $5 each, then send or email this to everyone you know!

   If you don't try it - you will never know!
