Our University is the result of one of America's fastest
growing web design companies. As the studio grew explosively
over a five-year period, they were faced with finding trained
professional web page designers. When they couldn't find existing
training centers to draw employees from, they did it the AMERICAN
way.......They created their own school!!

Students receive a package including fully functional,
all-inclusive software for use in the class, along with essential
trialware and freeware added to enhance your education experience.
This package alone, has an estimated retail value to the student
of hundreds of dollars!  This allows our students to learn without
investing large amounts of cash.

Guaranteed placement assistance is part of the total philosophy too!
Students successfully finishing this intense, hands-on training
will be guaranteed assistance on THREE levels in finding
work and employment for which they can be compensated for!

Our Student Advisors can put you in touch with dozens and dozens of
satisfied graduates who are glad to tell of their Design School
experiences and their new careers or part time lucrative businesses!

We point with pride to a few of our graduates
(ask for more examples from admissions):

Mark Mentzer says: 
"When I enrolled at The University I had little skills
in the web process. Now six months later they are providing
me with site work where I have earned from $400-$1000
in a 2-4 day period!  I've built a valuable portfolio that
I can market to potential clients or employees.  This school
was a big break for me."

Jennifer Den Adel said: 
"The staff at The University has been great.
In fact, I started out as an intern, and through this
past year I've found flexible hours, an invaluable
work experience, and the ability to earn a great income.
The School has opened the doors for me!"

Paul Luecke mentioned: 
"With the fantastic program at this school, I was able to pay for
my training in about two weeks worth of work for their clients! 
To learn this skill was great....but to have a program where the
University basically paid me to learn was unbelievable!"

After your graduation you also receive FREE Web Hosting Space
to display your work, AND, as your client base begins to soar,
we will provide graduates with ADDITIONAL HOSTING SPACE
FOR YOUR CLIENTS at next-to-cost pricing! This is a direct profit
center for YOU, the web designer, resulting from your clients
monthly fees paid directly to you, for hosting their sites.

Think it through...
If you develop your own clientele and you net just $50 a\
month from your hosting fees, 20 clients would bring you an
additional $1000 a month in hosting fees alone!  Now you see
why, as a Commercial Web Design Specialist...THERE ARE NO LIMITS!

Our staff of Student Counselors and Advisors will help to properly
structureyour proposed curriculum, and answer any questions you
may have when your call is returned.

(So we may continue to maintain our highest level of service,
class size will be limited each session, to better serve motivated
prospective students.)
