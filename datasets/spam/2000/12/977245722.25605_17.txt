Dear Friend:<BR>
<BR>
This is an extremely IMPORTANT announcement for you!<BR>
<BR>
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii=
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<BR>
                                     IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT<BR>
                                     IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT<BR>
                                     `````````````````````````````````````=
```````<BR>
                                       Your Future May Depend On It!!!<BR>
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii=
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<BR>
<BR>
BUT FIRST, please read the following Editorial Excerpts from some <BR>
important Publications in the United States:<BR>
<U> <BR>
New York Times</U> : "In concluding our review of financial organizations =
<BR>
to effect change in the 90's, special attention should be called to "World=
 <BR>
Currency Cartel"organization based in California. The members of this <BR>
organization are amassing hundreds of millions of dollars in the currency =
<BR>
market using a very LEGAL method which has NEVER been divulged to <BR>
the general public. While their purpose is not yet known, their presence <=
BR>
has most certainly been felt".<BR>
<BR>
<U> NBC Nightly News</U> : "Members of the World Currency Cartel organizat=
ion, <BR>
who always keep Low Profile of themselves, are some of the most powerful <=
BR>
and wealthiest people in this hemisphere".<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More Excerpts later, but first let us give you this <BR>
"Important Announcement".<BR>
 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
<BR>
We are glad to announce that for the very first time, the World Currency<B=
R>
Cartel organization will instruct a LIMITED number of people worldwide <BR=
>
on HOW TO CONVERT $25 INTO ONE HUNDRED OF LEGAL CURRENCY.<BR>
<BR>
We will transact the first conversation for you, after that you can quickl=
y <BR>
and easily do this on your own hundreds or thousands of times each and<BR>
every month. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS "SECRET FLAW"!<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<BR>
<BR>
It is even more explosive than we have yet disclosed. While currency does<=
BR>
fluctuates daily, we can show you HOW TO CONVERT $99 INTO $580<BR>
as many times as you want. That means, you will be able to convert $99<BR>
American Legal Currency Dollars for $580 OF THE SAME. You can do<BR>
this as many times as you wish, everyday, every week, every month. All <BR=
>
very LEGALLY and effortlessly!<BR>
<BR>
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<BR>
Due to the nature of this rare opportunity, we keep everything under<BR>
very Low Profile. We do not advertise anywhere and the information<BR>
is not available anywhere at all but from us. The reason we are sharing<BR=
>
this information with you is because we need few people to help us and<BR>
share the wealth around the world. You are one of the very few people to<B=
R>
receive this mail. Therefore, it is very important to emphasize on keeping=
 <BR>
it very Low Profile when you become a member.<BR>
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%<BR>
<BR>
It only takes about 5 to 10 minutes each time you do this. You can do this=
<BR>
from your home, your office or even while traveling. All you need is an ac=
cess<BR>
to a phone line and an address. Best of all, you can do this from ANY CITY=
<BR>
ON THIS EARTH!!!<BR>
<BR>
Again, we must reiterate, anyone can do this and the source is Never- Endi=
ng.<BR>
for as long the global financial community continues to use different curr=
encies<BR>
with varying exchange rate, this "SECRET FLAW" will exist.<BR>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D                          =
                     <BR>
<BR>
As we have said earlier, we will do the first transaction for you and will=
 also<BR>
show you exactly how to do this on your own over and over again.<BR>
<BR>
The amount of exchange you would do each time is entirely up to you.<BR>
Working just 2 to 10 hours a week, you can soon join the list of Millionai=
res<BR>
who do this on daily basis several times a day. The transaction is so simp=
le<BR>
that even a high school kid can do it!<BR>
<BR>
We at the World Currency Cartel organization would like to see a uniform<B=
R>

global currency backed by Gold. But, until then, we will allow a LIMITED<B=
R>
number of individuals worldwide to share in the Unlimited Profits provided=
<BR>
for by the world currency differentials.<BR>
<BR>
We will espouse no more political views nor will we ask you to do so. We<B=
R>
can say however, that our parent organization Wealth Exchange Int.<BR>
benefits greatly by the knowledge being shared as we ourselves along with<=
BR>
you benefit likewise. Your main concern surely will be, how you will benef=
it.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as you become a member, you can start making transactions<BR>
from your home, office, by telephone or through the mail and even while<BR=
>
traveling. As said earlier, we will do the first transaction for you and<B=
R>
will show you exactly how to do this on your own over and over again.<BR>
<BR>
No one can stop you from earning hundreds of thousands and even millions<B=
R>
of dollars each year for as long as this "SECRET  FLAW" exists. <BR>
