<FONT size=3D2><B> If you have any of these symptoms, then you may be "lig=
ht deprived."<BR>
This light deprivation is more commonly known as having the "Winter<BR>
Blues."<BR>
<BR>
Light therapy is used as a treatment for the winter blues and Seasonal<BR>
Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is a type of recurrent, major depression<BR>
regularly experienced by some people during the fall and winter months.<BR=
>
A milder version of SAD would be the Winter Blues. 11 times as many people=
 suffer from winter blues, compared to (SAD) SUFFERERS. <BR>
<BR>
Now YOU CAN BOOST the light in your life during these dark and gloomy wint=
er months.  We HAVE THE SOLUTION!<BR>
DAY-LIGHTS!  DAY-LIGHTS reproduce the sunlight you NEED during the<BR>
winter months by using a 10,000 lux bright light system.  Using a <BR>
DAY-LIGHT SYSTEM for 30 minutes a day in the morning is a first line treat=
ment for SAD, the winter blues, and Seasonal Depression.<BR>
*DAY-LIGHTS work because they reset the daily body clock (i.e.,<BR>
circadian rhythms), which, for people with SAD or the Winter Blues,<BR>
tends to get out of balance.<BR>
*Day-Lights work because they increase the levels of Serotonin (a neurotra=
nsmitter that positively affects moods), which would otherwise decrease in=
 the fall or winter.<BR>
<BR>
Retailers sell similar light box systems for over $600!!!<BR>
