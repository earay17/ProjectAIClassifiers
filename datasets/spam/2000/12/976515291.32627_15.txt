<FONT face=3D"Arial">
<FONT size=3D3><B> HERE ARE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO <BR>
MAKE $67,500 US CASH IN THE NEXT 3 WEEKS!</B>
<FONT size=3D3> <BR>
<BR>
There are 3 addresses listed below. <BR>
<BR>
Send the person at the TOP of the list a $10 bill wrapped in <BR>
pieces of paper (to securely hide it). Along with a note that <BR>
says: "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST". Then <BR>
DELETE the top name, move the other 2 up and PUT YOUR <BR>
NAME AT THE BOTTOM. <BR>
<BR>
Now starts sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. <BR>
When 30 people receive it, those 30 people will move your <BR>
name up to the middle position and they will each send out <BR>
30. That totals 900 people that will receive this letter with your <BR>
name in the middle.<BR>
 <BR>
Then, those 900 people will move your name up to the top and <BR>
they will each send out 30 E-mails. That totals 27,000 people that <BR>
will receive this E-mail with your name at the top and they will each <BR>
send you a $10 bill. 27,000 people each sending you a $10 bill =3D <BR>
$270,000 cash. That's if everyone responds to this E-mail, but not <BR>
everyone will, so you can expect more realistically to receive about <BR>
$67,500 cash $10 bills in your mailbox. <BR>
<BR>
This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but <BR>
send only a US CASH $10 bill. The more E-mail you send out, the <BR>
more cash you will receive. If each person sends out 100 E-mails. <BR>
There will be 1,000,000 people that receive this letter when your <BR>
name reaches the top. If only 1% of those people respond, you will <BR>
still get $100,000 cash. <BR>
<BR>
HERE'S THE LIST!<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------- <BR>
1. Christiane Pearson <BR>
    99 N Wightman St. <BR>
    Ashland, Oregon 97520 <BR>
<BR>
2. Vedaanta Vedadharma <BR>
    99 N Wightman St. <BR>
    Ashland, Oregon 97520 <BR>
<BR>
3. Hi'ilani Omayia <BR>
    325 "A" Street, Suite One <BR>
    Ashland, Oregon 97520 <BR>
--------------------------------------------------------- <BR>
<BR>
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name reaches the <BR>
top in a few days, you will start receiving $10 bills from other people <B=
R>
just like yourself, who are willing to play a $10 bill to receive $67,500 =
<BR>
cash. Nothing ventured; nothing gained in the spirit of FUN, let's play...=
<BR>
A little 15-year-old boy did $71,000 LEGALLY just by requesting <BR>
" Please add me to your mailing list". Why not you? <BR>
Wishing You Just the Very Best Happy Holiday. <BR>
