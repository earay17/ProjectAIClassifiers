 Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let me ask you a very straightforward question and <BR>
before you answer, think about it for a moment. <BR>
<BR>
When you have trouble making ends meet on today's<BR>
income, how do you expect to retire and live on <BR>
less money than you earn now?<BR>
<BR>
Read the question again before you go on -<BR>
it is a very serious question.<BR>
<BR>
If your income stopped today, how many<BR>
months could you survive in your current lifestyle<BR>
with no money coming in? What will be different in<BR>
your life two years from now if you continue<BR>
doing what you are doing now?<BR>
<BR>
Corporate America has conditioned us to believe <BR>
that security comes from employment.  Yet we hope <BR>
we never become the victims of downsizing, career<BR>
burn out, illness or injury.  The frightening <BR>
reality for most people is the plastic in their <BR>
wallets determines the quality of their lives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ask yourself, are you.....<BR>
<BR>
* Tired of working for someone else and getting <BR>
    paid what THEY tell you you're worth?<BR>
* Do your credit card balances total more than <BR>
    your bank accounts?<BR>
* Tired of the get rich quick on $5 fantasy <BR>
    programs?<BR>
* Tired of the Multi Level marketing residual<BR>
    income illusion?<BR>
* Looking for REAL wealth?<BR>
