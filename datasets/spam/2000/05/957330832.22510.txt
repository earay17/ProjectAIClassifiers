  "Here's how to Optimize your site for the Search Engines - Part 1" 
   ================================================================
                         by Paul Short


  Optimizing your website for better search engine rankings 
  requires some special knowlege and also takes a lot of time and 
  hard work to be done effectively. This article outlines only 
  the basic mechanics of website optimization. It is not meant to 
  be taken as a total solution to getting your site listed higher 
  in the search engine listings.

  Keep in mind the following main points as they are the basis 
  for the whole process.

  Focus: Your site should be focused on no more than three main 
  keywords or keyword phrases for maximum results.

  Content: Your site should be set up as a valuable resource of 
  information on one particular topic. This is how you'll 
  generate your keywords and phrases.

  Uniqueness: Your site should offer something that no one else 
  has. Concentrate on this as the theme of your site.

  Ok, let's jump right into the action.

  Optimizing Your Title
  ---------------------

  The main purpose of the title is to accurately describe what 
  your web page is all about. It tells in a few words why a 
  visitor is either on your site right right now, or why they 
  should click on your site in a search engine listing. You could 
  also look at it as your sites "Headline", and write it as just 
  that, a headline.

  Pick 3 main keywords or 2 - 3 keyword phrases and use them in 
  your title, but make sure the title still makes sense and also 
  offers the viewer a reason to choose your site. Be creative but 
  keep it relevant and stress your sites theme. Benefits sell. 
  Show the potential viewer the benefits right in the title.

  How am I suppose to include all that in my sites title? you 
  ask. Well, the most effective way is to do some research. Go to 
  the major search engines and type in keywords and phrases that 
  a potential viewer may enter if they were looking for the type 
  of information your site is offering. Out of the top 10 or so 
  sites that are listed, which has the most compelling title? In 
  other words, what would make you want to click on their site?

  Do this with several keywords and phrases, log the results on 
  on paper for use later and move on to the next section.

  Keyword selection
  -----------------

  This seems to be the "Holy Grail" of search engine submission 
  services and novices alike. The perfect keyword phrases. 
  Although having the right mix of keywords is important, your 
  goal is not only to get listed high in search results, but also 
  to get the right type of people to click on your site. 

  Prequalifying your sites viewers will bring quality traffic, 
  people more likely to take advantage of what your site has to 
  offer.

  With this in mind, write up a list of at least 25 keywords 
  and/or phrases based on the info you gathered in the previous 
  section on titles. Then take your list and cut and slash it 
  down to no more than 3 keywords or phrases most accurately 
  related to your sites content and purpose. These three keywords 
  will be the basis for your whole optimization process.

  They'll be used in your title, your META tags, the description 
  and body copy of your pages and even in the ALT text of your 
  images.


  META Tags
  --------- 

  The two main META tags used by most search engines are the:

  <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="your,keywords,here,">

  <META NAME="description" CONTENT="your description here"> 

  They are used by some, not all search engines along with your 
  sites title to index and rate your site in their listings and 
  also to provide the viewer with the text that appears when your 
  site shows up in search results.

  META keywords:
  -------------- 

  Use your keywords here with the most important ones first. Use 
  different variations like capitalized and lowercase, commonly 
  misspelled words etc. all followed by a comma with no space 
  after the comma and do not go over 255 characters.

  META description:
  -----------------

  Up to about 500 - 700 characters can be used here in the form 
  of a short keyword loaded descriptive paragraph.

  I cannot stress enough the importance of a good description 
  that accurately describes the benefits of your site, uses 
  your main keywords and phrases and also gives a compelling 
  reason for the potential viewer to click on your site in the 
  search results.

  You see, your sites title is the headline, the keywords give 
  the search engine spider the info on where to place your site 
  in it's database and the description you provide is like the ad 
  copy in a classified ad. Give the viewer a reason to click on 
  your site, sell them on what your website has to offer. 

          <Part 2 will be continued in the next Issue>
