  "Amazing Search Engine Secrets Discovered By A Computer 
   Illiterate Man in Massachusetts Can Practically Hand You the 
   Top Search Engine Positions...And Add 1,550 Hits a Day to 
   Web Site Overnight!"

   Dear Friend,

   Remember the first time you built a web site. You stayed up 
   until the early morning working it out so that it would be just 
   perfect. Then, you were finally done and you sat back and 
   thought, "The World is Good."

   After that, you've dreamed of all the visitors your site would 
   have, how they would all see your ad and buy your product.  
   Then it hit you, like a ton of bricks....How was anyone going 
   to find your web site?

   You thought about it for a while and eventually thought you 
   had the answer....submit your site to the search engines. 
   But after you submitted your site you checked it out and 
   couldn't find it.

   So you waited a few days.....and still nothing

   You couldn't even find your site if you looked up your own 
   name!!!

   Then, you got discouraged....after all that hard work 
   NOTHING?!?!?

   And this is where most people give up..... BUT You Don't 
   Have To...

   You can achieve top 20 positioning for your web site...
   and the tens of thousands of hits which come with it...if you 
   have the "Right" information available to you.

   For Example, did you know:

   * Infoseek, Alta Vista, and HotBot ban web sites which break 
     their rules (many of the 'insider' techniques most experts 
     recommend will get you banned faster than you could imagine).

   * Many search engines limit the number of pages you can submit 
     from your domain (some only allow you to submit one page 
     for best results), although we can show you a technique we 
     use to get hundreds of our pages listed.

   * Yahoo only lists about 1% of the web in their actual directory.  
     To even get your page listed, you may have to use the "backdoor".

   * Using a so-called search engine submission software that 
     submits your site to 1,000 or more search engines could 
     actually get your page deleted from the major search engines.

   * 95% of Internet traffic originates at one of the 10 major search 
     engines... If you're not listed, you might as well not even have 
     a web site!

   * Choosing the most effective 'keywords' is one of the major keys 
      to a successful web site submission...Pick the right ones and 
     your web site will look like Grand Central Station during rush hour!

  It has taken us over 2 years to learn how to consistently and without 
  fail place any type of web site in the top 20 of the major search engines.

  Normally, we charge $500 per keyword that you want a top ranking 
  on (plus a monthly fee of $150 for keeping that rank), but we have 
  found we just don't have enough time for all of the clients that 
  desperately need our services...

  So, we have produced a "Search Engine Magic" interactive CD-ROM 
  that will show you step by step how to create pages which storm the 
  search engines and lay hold to the precious Top 20 positions that 
  millions of people are trying to reach.

  The Search Engine Magic CD-ROM consists of 21 interactive 
  video and audio lessons that will run on any IBM compatible 
  computer showing you the exact step-by-step process we use 
  to traffic thousands of visitors to our web sites every single day.

  You will learn:

   * Three Different Methods We Use to Pick the Best Traffic Producing 
      Keywords for any web site...and how you can have a list of hundreds 
     of popular keywords in only a few minutes.

   * How Quick and Easy it is to Create 'Doorway' and 'Hallway' pages 
      for the search engines so that you could possibly have thousands of 
     different pages on your domain all pulling in visitors for your site 24 
     hours a day 7 days a week.

   * The Secret Weapon that gives you an "Unfair Advantage" over your
     competition...and virtually assures you will reach the top positions 
     (don't let your competitors hear about this one first or you will be in 
      trouble).

   * How to Submit Your Pages to the Search Engines and assure that 
     every single one of them gets listed. (if you listen to one of those 
     amateurs tell you how to list your site,  you may just get banned for life).

   * How to Use Pay-Per-Click search engines to receive over 10,000 
     visitors for only $100

   * The Infamous Yahoo backdoor...You can get listed and we will show 
     you the quickest and easiest method for doing so!

  * And much, much more...

  Even Better, You'll Get the Same Results For A Fraction of What 
  Everyone Else Had to Pay!

  Listen: A lot of people all over the world are gonna be furious with 
  me for sharing these "Insider Secrets" with you...especially since 
  you won't be paying even part of what they had to shell out for one 
  top positioning page!

  That's just too bad.  It's been a secret for too long.  So, let me tell 
  you what the deal is....

  Contact us today using the below Risk-Free Response Form and 
  you can have all of our secrets for only $139.00, plus $5.00 S&H, 
  $144.00 Total

  This price wouldn't even buy you 10 minutes of our time at our regular
  submission fees, but you can own the top search engine positions for 
  less than the cost of a few classified ads!  You will be learning 
  everything we know about top positioning!

  That, my friend, is the bargain of a lifetime for a serious Internet 
  marketer like yourself.  What's more, the money is actually irrelevant, 
  because...

  You Also Get a 90 Day No-Risk 100% Money-Back Guarantee!

  Here's how it works.  Order your personal copy of this CD-ROM, 
  and use it like you own it.  If...For any reason or no reason at all, 
  you aren't completely satisfied after 90 days (by which I had over 
  47 Top 20 positions for my own website), just send the CD-ROM 
  back in any condition, and I personally guarantee you to get a 
  complete refund of your purchase price.  No questions asked.  
  No problems or forms to fill out.  No problems at all.

  PLUS, You Will Also Receive What is Considered to be by most 
  experts as the "Ultimate Bonus!"

  For the first 50 people who fill out the below response form and 
  send it in, you will also receive UNLIMITED REPRINT AND 
  REPRODUCTION RIGHTS to this CD-ROM for LIFE!

  I am not going to allow this CD-ROM to become like many of 
  those over-advertised products you see out there, so only the 
  first 50 will receive these rights.

  This means that you will be able to use this exact same sales 
  letter, copy the CD-ROM yourself, and sell it

  For $139.00 a copy, you need only one sale to breaking even.  
  Sell two copies and you will have a profit. This isn't even counting 
  what the CD-ROM package will do for you!

  Since this extraordinary offer is made to the first  50 people... you 
  must take action today!

  Yours in Success, 
  Jim Bryan
