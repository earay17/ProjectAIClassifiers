COFFEE AFFICIONADOS KNOW THAT COSTA RICAN COFFEE IS THE
BEST IN THE WORLD.

Costa Rican coffee has been traditionally mixed with other coffees to
upgrade blends that are destined for worldwide export, to give them a
liveliness and body.  But increasingly today, consumers are demanding
the
unadulterated stuff:100 percent pure Costa Rican coffee.  All of the
elements in that country seem to combine to produce what afficionados
consider to be the best of the best coffees, perhaps superior to any in
the
world from the Costa Rican highland regions around Poas,
Barva de Heredia, Tres Rios and Tarrazu.

Now you can have this coffee, delivered by Priority Mail directly to
your
door. (US deliveries only at this time.)  We offer this in 1/2 kilo(1.1
lb) bags
of roasted ground or roasted whole bean.  Our minimum order is 2 bags
(2.2 lbs) at $10.50 per bag + $5.50 S&H ($26.50).  Order 10Kilos(20bags)

or more for your office or resale and we will discount our regular price
to
$8.50 per bag.

For your convenience, we also offer automatic reshipments of your order
at any weekly interval you select.  If you would like to participate in
this
program, just select the coffee club box on the order form, and enter
your
desired weekly interval.  This means you don't ever have to worry about
running out of coffee at your home or office again, just because you
forgot
to order.  There is no additional charge for this service.

To ensure delivery of the freshest product possible, your order will be
shipped
from bags packed that same day!  These will be delivered to your home or
