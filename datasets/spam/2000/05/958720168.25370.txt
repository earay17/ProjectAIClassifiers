Parents of 15 year old find $71,000 in CASH in closet!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Does this headline look familiar?  Of course it does.  You most likely
have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news 
program (USA).

His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her son's closet.  Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash.  Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds- all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year."

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered.  He came home right away and they drove thogether to the boy's school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the 
internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he 
obtained off of the internet.  Everyday after school for the past 
2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I 
put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it 
out", says the clever 15-year-old.

The E-mail letter listed 3 addresses and contained instructions to 
send three $5 dollar bills to the people on the list, then delete the top address and move the other 2 addresses up, and finally to add 
your name to the bottom of the list.  The letter goes on to state
that you would receive several thousand dollars in 5$ dollar 
bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at 
the bottom of the 3-address list "I get junk E-mail all the time, 
and I really didn't think it was gonna work", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office 
Box that his parents had gotten for his video-game magazine 
subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes 
containing $5 dollar bills.  "about a week later I rode (my bike) 
down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
envelopes stuffed in it.  There was a yellow slip that said I had 
to go up to the (post office) counter- I thought I was in trouble 
or something (laughs)".  He goes on, "I went up to the counter and 
they had a whole box of more mail for me.  I had to ride back home 
and empty out my backpack 'cause I couldn't carry it all". 

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.  
"The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and 
stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my homework". 
 He had also been riding his bike to several of the area's banks 
and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.  
"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to 
different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack.  
I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had 
sent me in (to exchange the money) and he was outside waiting for 
me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me 
that she wouldn't be able to do it for me and my dad would have to 
come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street 
(laughs)".

Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.  The 
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 
'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't 
a chain-letter at all.  In fact, it was completely legal according 
to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or 
Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal 
regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which states a product or service must be exchanged for money received.

Every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that 
read, "Please add me to your mailing list". This simple note made 
the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (adding the 
purchasers name to his mailing list) for a five dollar fee.  Here 
is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail, you 
can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the 
instructions in the letter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are instructions on how to make $10,000 US cash in the next 
2 weeks:

There are 3 addresses listed below.

Send the three people on the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces 
of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note that says: "Please 
add me to your list".

Then delete the top name, move the other 2 up and put your name at the bottom.

Now start sending this ENTIRE E-mail back out to people.  When 20 
people receive it, those 20 people will send you $5 and move your 
name up to the middle position and they will each send out 20 emails. 
That totals 400 people that will receive this letter with your name in 
the middle. Then, those 400 people will send you $5 and move your 
name to the top!

HERE IS WHERE IT GET'S VERY INTERSTING!

When 400 people email it to 20 others, 8,000 will recieve the email 
with your namee at the top! 8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill 
= $40,000 cash.  That's if everyone responds to this E-mail, but 
not everyone will, so you can expect more realistically to receive 
about $10,000 cash $5 bills in your mailbox. But some of you may 
receive A WHOLE LOT MORE!

This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but 
send only a US CASH $5 bill.

The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive.  If 
each person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people 
that receive this letter when your name reaches the top.  If only 1% of 
those people respond, you will get $50,000 cash.

Here is the list:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) MP Chiro
   310 N Springboro pk
   Dayton, Oh 45449

2) A Wyrick 
   1628 Silverlake    
   Centerville, Oh 45458

3) S Koch
   1441 Forest Ln
   Garland, Tx 75042
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO!  When your email reaches others. you will start receiveing $5 bills from people just like yourself, who are willing to invest three $5 bills to receive $10,000 or more in cash!

So get started right away! Put your name at the bottom, send the three people $5 each, then send or email this to everyone you know!

If you don't try it-you will never know!
