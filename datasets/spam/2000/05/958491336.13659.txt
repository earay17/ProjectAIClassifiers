Dear Bruce:

My Name is Guy Keeler and I live in Saskatoon. I am an independent
representative for Excel Telecommunications (Canada) Inc.

I came across your resume on the web and felt I should let you know
about an exciting opportunity which you may be interested in. Excel has
been in business for 10 years in the US and expanded to Canada a little
more than a year ago after merging with Teleglobe Inc.. Bell Canada
Enterprises has now recently acquired Teleglobe. Excel also has
expansions planned to a number of European countries.

Excel's formula combines a strong line of telecommunications products,
specifically long distance plans, with a direct selling business model.
The result has been a remarkable business opportunity for me. Anyone
with the entrepreneurial drive and commitment to make money and help
others do the same will be a success.

Excel Canada is actively looking for Independent Representatives to sell

its services on a part time or full time basis.

As an independent representative this is what I do...

I gather customers to use Excel services and I find some friends who are

interested in earning an income to join our Excel Canada team.

There are three ways to participate in the Excel opportunity...

For a totally refundable $75 application deposit Excel will provide you
with all of the materials needed to start your Excel business.

For $325 and an annual renewal fee of $215 you can purchase the optional

management services program which will allow you to be trained by a
certified trainer. Also, under this option, Excel tracks your
organization, provides a home office support system, monthly statements
and in information magazine.

Many of our most successful reps have also chosen to become trainers.
This separate and optional training position, called Area Coordinator,
allows you to earn $40 every time you train a new managing
representative. The cost to become and Area Coordinator is $415 with an
annual renewal fee of $120.

To help each of us become better at our individual Excel businesses, we
have local and regional meetings, training, and internet information
site, and an internal phone network just for Independent
representatives.

If you are interested in finding out more about the Excel opportunity,
please contact me at g.keeler@sympatico.ca.
