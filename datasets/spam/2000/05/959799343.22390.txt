This report contains abstracts of a selection of periodical articles, reports, and company annual accounts held by
the Business Information Centre (BIC). Periodically, a
bibliography is included at the end of the bulletin, drawing
together items held by BIC on a particular subject or
country.

Items in the 'UK and General' section cover British electricity
industry developments, and items of wider interest - for example:  technology, global environmental matters, and management issues.  The 'International' section will focus
mainly on developments in the electricity markets and industries around the world, and on other topics very specific to particular countries or groups of countries.
