Dear Individual and Independent Investor:
 
Once upon a time an investor depended upon his broker or 
investment advisor to handle his/her investments. Now you can 
handle your own investments.  You can simply go online with 
E-Trade or AmeriTrade, et al, and click your mouse and buy... 
what???
 
This is where Wall Street Whispers comes into the picture. We 
provide you, on a daily basis, education and direction -- as well 
as giving you some real winners.  
 
FOR EXAMPLE:
 
In our August 6, 1999, issue: AREMISSOFT CORP (AREM) trading at 
7; it went to 49 3/4; and closed Friday, March 17,2000, at 41.
 
In our August 11, 1999, issue: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (FPCX) 
trading at 0.56; it went to 17; and closed Friday, March 17, 
2000, at 10.
 
Also in our August 11, 1999, issue: APPLIED MATERIALS (AMAT) 
trading at 76 15/16; it went past 185, split two-for-one, and 
closed Friday, March 17, 2000, at 95 55/64!!!  NOTE: We had 
already told you about AMAT in our July 2, 1999, issue, when it 
was trading at 73 7/8.
 
We don't look for stocks that are selling for 0.20 today, big 
hype tomorrow, up to ????, and out of business next week.  We 
look for companies that have value, whether their stock is 
trading at five cents or fifty dollars at the moment. AREM. FPCX, 
and AMAT are just  three of the winners that we gave our readers 
in August (there were others). Want to know how we did in 
September???  Just click this link yes@wallstwhispers.com and 
then click your "send" button.  We will get back to you.  Easy, 
isn't it? 
 
With best regards,
