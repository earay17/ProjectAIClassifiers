Please help us stop drunk drivers.

This is a personal issue to me, my family has been shaken by drunken driving.

Show your support by going to http://www.skate.on.ca/jess

For every person that goes to the website, we can potentially raise $3 (no cost to you) towards stopping drunk driving!

Thanks,
