Here is how to make several thousand dollars within the next 2 
weeks.  Don’t laugh and don’t roll your eyes, I’m telling you how 
to do it right here on one page:

You DON’T send $5 to five people. 
You DON’T buy reports or recipes, or anything else.

All you need is one $5 bill and about 1 hour, nothing more.  You 
don’t invest anymore time or money after that.

This is 100% legal:  Refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 
18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US 
code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be 
exchanged for money received.
 
Here is how to do it:

There are 3 names with addresses listed below.

Send the person in the #1 position on the list a $5 bill wrapped 
in 2 pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note 
that   says: "Please add me to your mailing list" (this note is 
what makes this legal because you are exchanging money for a 
service).

Then delete that name in the #1 position, move the other 2 up and 
add your name and address to the now vacant #3 position on the 
list.  That’s it.

Finally, E-mail the new modified version of this letter with your 
name/address at the #3 position to AS MANY people as you can.  
The more people you send it to the more cash you will generate.

Here is the list:

"IT'S OUTRAGEOUS!!! I sent this E-mail out for 2 hours and I have 
made over $11,000 in $5 bills within three weeks...
And my investment was just one $5 bill!! I LOVE IT! Thank you 
11,000 times"

If you haven’t already figured it out, here’s how this works:

Lets say you send out 20 E-mails with your name at the #3 spot to 
20 people, then those 20 people move your name up to the #2 spot 
and they each send out 20 emails.  Now there are 400 emails out 
there with your name at #2.  Now those 400 people move your name 
up to #1 and they each send out 20 E-mails...that makes 8,000 
emails with your name at #1.  When those 8,000 people each send 
you a $5 bill, you end up receiving $40,000 cash all within about 
a 2-week time frame.

Now, when you send out 20 E-mails, not all 20 of those people are 
going to respond.  Some of those 20 people are going to simply 
delete this E-mail because they obviously don’t need any extra 
cash or they just like working their $6/hour slave jobs.

So, lets assume that with the above example only 5% respond to 
this E-mail.  Well that still leaves you making $2,000, which is 
not bad at all considering you only sent out 20 E-mails.

Of course, the MORE E-mails that you send out, the more cash YOU 
WILL RECEIVE IN YOUR MAILBOX.  What if you initially send out 
1,000 E-mails? DO THE MATH ON THAT!


"I ran this E-mail several times last year. The first time I 
received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks and over 
$20,000
cash in the next three times I ran it."

You would never believe how many people worldwide make an 
incredible living off of these types of programs.  Do you keep 
receiving these types of E-mails?  Do you know why you keep 
getting them? Because ALL OVER THE WORLD, everyday people are 
making thousands and thousands of dollars with these types of 
programs, THAT’S WHY you keep getting them.

YOU CAN DO THIS TODAY, RIGHT NOW....IF YOU DON’T INVEST $5 AND 
TRY THIS- YOU WILL NEVER KNOW.
