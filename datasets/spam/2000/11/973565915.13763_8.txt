Our research has found that many people have tried one or more of
the following...
 
    Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)
    Web Site? (Takes thousands of visitors)
    Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
    E-Zine? (Hope they have a *huge* subscriber list)
    Search Engines? (Forget it, unless you're in the top 20)
    
         S O   W H A T   W I L L   W O R K ? 

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has proven

*** Just Released and even better - 15 Million addresses ***
 
Over the past 6 years, we have gained a reputation for having the
cleanest, most responsive e-mail address lists in the industry.
No one has gone to the work it takes to produce an e-mail address
list of this quality.  The number #1 problem with email lists are 
deliverability.  You may have seen dozens of ads for lists or CD's
or you may have purchased a list in the past.  Chances are, the list
was produced 6 months, 1 year or even two years ago!  

Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists:

1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates. 

2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even
more. No address with inappropriate or profane wording survives!

3. Then we use our private database of thousands of known
Internet "extremists", those opposed to any kind of commercial
e-mail, and kicked off every one we could find.

4. All domains were verified to insure they're valid.

5. And finally, we sorted the list into easy-to-manage packets of
20,000 addresses in simple text (.txt) format that will work with
any computer operating system. 

WHAT DID WE END UP WITH?

		M I L L I O N S   V O L U M E   13
                    15 Million Addresses Strong!
 
With this super clean e-mail address lists you'll send less...and
get better results... 
 
    * Y O U   G E T   W H A T   Y O U   P A Y   F O R *
 
Our FRESH 15 Million, Volume 13 Address List CD, will result in:
 
* Higher Response Rates
* Higher Sales Conversion Ratios
* More Receptive prospects; Less Flames & Non-Buyers.
* Less Contact With Anti-Commerce Radicals & Extremists.
			
This is not a rental list that is restricted to a one-time
mailing.  You are purchasing an e-mail address list for your own
personal mailings and may use it over-and-over.

DON'T HESITATE on this offer or you will miss out on the least
expensive, most effective way to market... PERIOD!
