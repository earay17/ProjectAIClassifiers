Hello. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ron, and I am a 
professional astrologer.

Although many people are curious about astrology in general, few know what 
an astrologer can actually do for them. Astrology is distinct from other 
forms of "fortune telling" in that it is equally powerful as a tool for 
self-understanding as it is for predicting the future. Yes, I can tell you 
what is going to happen in your life in future, but (perhaps more 
importantly) Astrology can be the key to making the most of your life. As 
Bill Maher, host of ABC's "Politically Incorrect", once said: "I believe you 
can learn more about yourself in an hour with a good astrologer than you can 
in a year with a therapist."

At the same time, the great strength of Astrology is that it DOES predict 
the future, not merely as an extension of your own actions, but as a result 
of the forces in operation in the universe as a whole.

Most people gain their introduction to Astrology through "sun-sign" 
forecasts in the local newspaper. Although a well-written sun-sign forecast 
can have some validity, it's a little like a doctor making a diagnosis based 
on just taking your blood pressure. In the hands on a real astrologer your 
date, time, and place of birth can reveal:

-Relationship patterns, past present and future, for loved ones of all 
types.
-Career and finance guidance and prediction
-Patterns of strength and weakness in the individual's health
-And more

A consultation with an astrologer can be a life-changing experience, not 
only because it can predict future trends, but can equip you to deal with 
them effectively.

I can provide services via Internet, phone, or in person (in the Regina 
area). For more information, please contact me at ronastrologer@hotmail.com, 
or via ICQ (RonAstrologer, ICQ number 99209907).

Thanks,

Ron.
