<p>Dear Windows User,<br>
<br>
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 3.x, 95 and 98 to<br>
nearly the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and&nbsp;
<br>
industrial<br>
version of Windows.<br>
<br>
The new WinFix 4.3 is a very effective way to improve the reliability of<br>
Windows, because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing. And<br>
WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of<br>
Windows.<br>
<br>

more about WinFix,<br>
the safest, most effective way to keep you working, by keeping your PC<br>
working non-stop.<br>
