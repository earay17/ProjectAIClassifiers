<FONT size=3> Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
This letter is about an opportunity to make an incredible amount of<BR>
Money ( CASH !!!) in a very short time. The cost is only $6.00! This is the 16th <BR>
day since I started receiving $ cash, and so far I have received $5,845 (in $1 Bills)...so <BR>
I guess this is really working! Give it a try! All I did was follow the instructions in <BR>
the letter that I received below, and sent out some e-mail to people who responded <BR>
to my ads.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a testimony from one of the thousands who have benefited from<BR>
this simple investment plan.<BR>
<BR>
"I'm a retired attorney, and about a year ago a man came to me with a<BR>
letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before you now. He asked <BR>
me to verify that this letter was legal. I told him that I would review it and get <BR>
back to him. When I first read the letter, I thought it was some off the wall idea to make <BR>
money. A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue. I told him that <BR>
the letter would be all right. I was curious about the letter, so he told me how it <BR>
worked. I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against participating. Before my client left,<BR>
I asked him to keep me updated as to his results. About two months later he called me to <BR>
tell me that he had received more than $800,000.00 in cash! I didn't believe him. <BR>
So he asked me to try the plan and see for myself."<BR>
<BR>
"I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much<BR>
to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters. Sure<BR>
enough the money started coming in! It came slowly at first, but after three <BR>
weeks I was getting more than I could open in a day. After three months the money <BR>
stopped coming. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totalled<BR>
$868,439.00. I earn a good living as an attorney, but as anyone in the legal <BR>
profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes with the territory. I decided<BR>
if things worked out, I would retire from practice and play golf. This time I <BR>
sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had totalled $2,344,178.00."<BR>
<BR>
"I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works. He told<BR>
me that there were a few similar letters going around. What made this one<BR>
different is the fact that there were six names on the letter, not three like <BR>
most others. That act alone resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice <BR>
I gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no one wants<BR>
to risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are curious about what little<BR>
changes I told him to make. Well, if you send a letter like this one, to be<BR>
legal, you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him <BR>
that anyone sending a dollar must received something in RETURN. So when you send <BR>
a dollar to each of the six names on the list, you must include a slip<BR>
of paper saying, "Please add me to your mailing list" and include your name and<BR>
mailing address. This is the key to the program. The item you will receive for your dollar <BR>
sent, is THIS letter and the right to earn thousands."<BR>
<BR>
Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three months<BR>
you should receive MORE THAN $800,000.00 IN COLD HARD CASH!<BR>
<BR>
1) IMMEDIATELY send $1.00 (US$) to each of the six people listed below. <BR>
THE SOONER YOU SEND THE "$1.00 LETTERS" THE SOONER YOU CAN <BR>
START GETTING A RETURN! Wrap the dollar in a note saying <BR>
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST".<BR>
<BR>

6. Marianne Saum 570 Kumquat Dr. San Jose, CA 95117<BR>
<BR>
2) REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to #1 at the top of the list and <BR>
move the rest of the names UP one position. Then place YOUR name<BR>
in the # 6 spot. This is best done by saving this to a file and entering<BR>
your information on line # 6. Be careful when you type the addresses. <BR>
Don't forget to PROOF-READ them. Make SURE that the names and <BR>
addresses are correct. <BR>
<BR>
3) When you have COMPLETED the above instructions, you have several <BR>
options on how you market the letter - through the Postal Service, through E-mail, through<BR>
posting in "FREE CLASSIFIED ADS" and "NEWSGROUPS" ON THE INTERNET, or <BR>
through whatever way you think is most effective.<BR>
<BR>
To send this letter out to thousands of people and increase your<BR>
profits, I suggest you use a Bulk E-mail company. Call 207-896-7915 to have your <BR>
letter e-mailed. They are fast, effective and give excellent service.<BR>
100,000 emailings costs just $89.00 and they are running a special now<BR>

<BR>
This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above as long<BR>
as you follow the instructions, because you are purchasing membership in our <BR>
exclusive mailing list. The more you send out, the more YOU will make. We strongly <BR>
encourage you to mail this letter to family, friends, and relatives as well.<BR>
<BR>
THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL. (Refer to title 18, section 1302<BR>
&1341 of the US Postal and Lottery Laws)<BR>
<BR>
Assume for example you get a 8% return rate.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
2) Those 16 people mail out 200 letters, (3200 letters) and ONLY 256<BR>
people send you $1.00<BR>
<BR>
3) Those 256 people mail out 200 letters, (51,200 letters) and ONLY 4,096 people <BR>

people send you $1.00. At the Next level your name-drops off the list.<BR>
<BR>
Think about it. Look what you WILL have BEFORE your name-drops off the<BR>
list! I know this looks and sounds unbelievable. Just try it, and you will be<BR>
happy that you did because you will received proof when THOUSANDS of <BR>
ONE-DOLLAR BILLS start to pile up!<BR>
<BR>
***MAKE SURE you send One US dollar to each of the six names on the list. (This is VERY IMPORTANT),<BR>
with a note saying "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST"<BR>
<BR>
P.S. You've read this far, so let me ask you one simple question,<BR>
<BR>
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?<BR>
<BR>
Even with a 1% return you will still get $100,000.00 in 90 DAYS!!! What you can gain is an income, like the example in this letter. You will have a very small expense, but you will reap HUGE <BR>
potential returns. What do you have to lose? I invite you to JOIN our mailing list RIGHT NOW!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks you for your time. GOOD LUCK & BEST WISHES TO YOU !!!<BR>
