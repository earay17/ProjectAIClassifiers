    <br>
    Nu Electric Corporation (NRGE - OTCBB - 1 1/2) is an incubator company=
 that identifies,
    acquires, develops, and markets emerging technologies that conserve en=
ergy and protect and
    enhance the world&#146;s natural resources. NRGE recently acquired Cle=
an Water
    Technologies, Inc., which gives NRGE exclusive worldwide license to it=
s proprietary
    technology (developed at the University of South Florida by Dr. Dagmar=
 Bonnin) for the
    removal of arsenic from drinking water using zeolite minerals. Recent =
studies show arsenic
    to be even more toxic than was previously thought, which prompted the =
EPA to classify
    arsenic as a human carcinogen. The EPA is proposing (by January 2001) =
to lower the maximum
    allowable concentration level of arsenic for drinking water from the p=
resent 50 parts per
    billion (ppb) to 5 ppb or less. This will meet the new proposed standa=
rd intended to
    protect consumers against the effects of long-term, chronic exposure t=
o arsenic in
    drinking water. The new standard will apply to all 54,000 community wa=
ter systems, serving
    approximately 254 million people.<br>
    <br>
    <a href=3D"http://3506561042/nuelc2000/">NRGE</a> has also recently
    acquired Zorax, Inc., which owns the exclusive worldwide license for a=
 technology that
    extracts and identifies dangerous Cryptosporidium and Giardia, two wat=
erborne parasites
    that can cause serious gastrointestinal problems. NRGE, a fully report=
ing company with no
    long-term debt, has yet to record revenues, but is emerging from the c=
urrent development
    stage and should become a profitable company in a multi-billion dollar=
 market. Of the </font><font
