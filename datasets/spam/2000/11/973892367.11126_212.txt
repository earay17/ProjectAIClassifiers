Moms can now work from home -- This is a REAL business situation available to you anywhere in the US! 
REMOVE instructions at end of letter. Read on, to learn how to legitimately help doctors in your area! 

Anywhere in the United States, there are doctors who see hundreds of patients each week and each 
month—at their office, in the hospital, in nursing homes, etc.  And Medicare, Medicaid, and many private 
insurers and HMOs are requiring these thousands of insurance claims to be filed electronically – not the 
old-fashioned paper claims!

YOU CAN HELP DOCTORS NOW by picking up their patient charges and filing them electronically – from 
your PC at home.  Everything you need to know is compiled into a 200-page book, “The E-Claim Wealth 
Formula,” by Joyce L. Tolliver, MHA.  Joyce is a mom who wanted to work from home in 1987, when her 
son Jaye was born 9 weeks prematurely – and she needed to keep the family income up in order to pay for 
his medical expenses.

Joyce Tolliver holds a Masters Degree in Healthcare Administration (MHA) from the University of LaVerne in 
California – and has over 20 years’ experience processing healthcare insurance claims for physicians.  
She established her own business, Medical Reimbursement Specialists, Inc. in 1987 – working from home 
for about six physicians.  In 1990 she started training others to do the work from home, and to date has 
helped over a thousand individuals and couples to establish their own e-claims business.

“The E-Claim Wealth Formula” contains how-to information, step-by-step of how to get clients, how to set 
up your computer, how to file an insurance claim electronically, how to contract with doctors, how to be 
sure you’re paid correctly, etc.  It contains forms, contracts, ideas, and specific information that will make 
you successful!  Order by November 30, 2000 and you will receive information to obtain special claims 
software for only $99!

So just how much money can you make?  There are no guarantees here – and you will get out of this 
business exactly what you put into it.  But, because the need is so widespread, and the lack of qualified 
employees is so severe right now, you should be able to do well – even with only a few clients!  Here’s a 
sample formula:

Most doctors will need about 100 claims filed each week.  Some more, some less.  If you charge an 
average of only $5 per claim, that’s $500 gross income per week, per doctor.  It’s fairly easy to get 3-5 
doctors, so you could multiply it like this:

100 claims/week x 4 weeks/month x $5 x  4 doctors = $8,000/month gross income.  (This is an estimate 
ONLY – you may make more or less!)

Of course, you’ll have to pay processing charges – that’s a cost of doing business – but “The E-Claim 
Wealth Formula” reveals an important trade secret: Where to go to find a clearinghouse that charges a 
monthly subscription fee, not a per-claim processing fee!  You’ll literally save hundreds of dollars per month 
with this 1 small – but key – piece of information!

Why wait?  Within 90 days of receiving this excellent home business publication, you could be making 
$5,000 - $10,000 per month!  Others are doing it right now!  And, if you place your order by November 30, 
2000, you can also receive information on how to obtain a FREE LIST of “hard-copy submitters” (doctors 
who still are filing old-fashioned paper claims) from your area.    

“The E-Claim Wealth Formula” regularly sells for $99.95.  When you order by November 30, 2000, you can 
order it for only $79.95 + $4 P&H.  Make your checks (remember to allow up to 3 weeks for clearing of 
personal or business checks) or money orders payable to:  MRS, Inc. and mail to:
