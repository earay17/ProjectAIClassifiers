SUBJECT: Canadians: Vote To Keep Canada Strong and Free! 
Content-Length: 2142

We don't like invading your privacy, but we're scared! Afraid that Canada is becoming the 51st U.S. state, while the politicians and media say nothing! 

Here's why we're worried: 

- Every day, about five Canadian companies, from high-tech to health-care, are sold to foreign, mainly U.S. corporations at 65 cents on the dollar. More than 13,000 businesses lost since the Free Trade Agreement was signed. Last year was a record year -- double the record set in 1998! 

- Under NAFTA, American corporations have greater rights than Canadian companies even though they are run from the U.S., have more money and power, and their profits go south instead of remaining here to help our economy. Not a level playing field! 

- Chapter 11 of NAFTA allows any U.S. business to sue our federal, provincial or municipal governments if the company thinks a law will hurt its profits or future profits. This could bankrupt us! And it's undemocratic because our governments are afraid to pass laws that protect us. 

- Our health-care and education systems are being privatized because NAFTA -- and soon the World Trade Organization -- says they are "open season"! Do we really want our health care run by U.S. conglomerates? Think about it. 
The Canadian Action Party (CAP) was formed because Canada is headed for trouble! Our country and our democracy are in danger. 
On November 27, we need your vote to keep the True North strong and free! Please forward this to your family and friends -- because every vote counts.

Canada for future generations!

Please note: In ridings where we don't have a candidate, vote anything but Liberal or Alliance because both will continue to sell-out the country. 

O Canada or No Canada? The Choice Is Yours! 
Thank you for your time,

The Hon. Paul Hellyer, Leader, Canadian Action Party 
Authorized by the Official Agent for the Canadian Action Party
