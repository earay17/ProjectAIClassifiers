While technological improvement and innovation are ever present these days, the surface mining industry is still using the same basic methods it was 50 years ago. True it is using bigger equipment bigger trucks, bigger shovels and bigger draglines and these are dispatched with high tech systems including GPS tracking and software but the basic methods have not changed.

Underground mining has proven to be more energy efficient and less disruptive to the environment than surface mining. Moreover, with proper engineering, underground methods are applicable in many mining situations today.
