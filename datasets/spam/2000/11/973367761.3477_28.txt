HOW TO MAKE OVER $79,000 A YEAR BY USING FREE VOICEMAIL

Costs you nothing to start, and you can start right away, and create profits
within the hour!

NOTE:  It is not necessary to have internet access to do what I am about to show
you, however, you will need the internet briefly to get started, and for a few
minutes every month or two.  If you do not have internet access, just use a
public library internet computer.  This will only take around 10 minutes for you
to set up.

NOTE#2:  You MUST follow these instructions exactly, or this will not work.  If,
however, you already have a free account with
TheMail, then skip step #1.

1.-Go to http://themail.com/ref.htmref=1538760 and open a free email account.

2.-Go to http://www.onebox.com and open a free voicemail/fax/email account with
them.

3.-In your Onebox email, add your TheMail email address to the address book.

4.-Also in your TheMail account, go into tools, and set up the autoresponder
with a message that has this very message that you are reading (simply copy this
letter into the autoresponder, but remember to change the TheMail http://
address in step 1 to the affiliate URL that you were given when you signed up
with them. For example, http://www.themail.com/yourID

5.-Go back into your OneBox email, and send a blank email to your TheMail email
address, then wait a few minutes.

6.-Then check your OneBox email, and see if you just got an email from your
TheMail account, with the autoresponder message you just set up.  If not, wait
about 10 minutes, then check again.  If you still have not, then go back to your
TheMail account, and activate the autoresponder function, and wait 20 minutes.

7.-Log into your OneBox email, if you have not done so already, and click on the
link at the bottom that says that you can get free business cards.

8.-Create your free business cards online at the site that will be provided. 
Make sure to put your OneBox voicemail phone number on the business cards, NOT
your home phone.  Your free business cards will arrive in the mail within a week
or two.

9.-Now call your OneBox voicemail, and create a personal greeting.  The greeting
should be an advertisement, that says something like the following:

"Hello, my name is ________, and I would like to show you how you can make over
$79,000 a year with free voicemail.  This will cost you nothing to start, and
you can start right away, and earn profits as soon as you are set up.  For
details on getting set up, email (your TheMail email address), or leave your
mailing address, and I will contact you shortly.  For quickest response, I
suggest you email (your TheMail email address)."
If the person emails your TheMail address, then the autoresponder you set up
will automatically email them this letter that you are reading, and you won't
have to lift a finger, or get on the internet at all.  If the person leaves
their mailing address instead, then you will
simply need to mail this letter to them.

10.-Every day, call your voicemail to listen to your emails, voicemails, and
faxes (yes, ALL of this can be listened to over the phone. You do not have to
log on to the internet to hear your emails, etc.)  After you are done listening,
send 7 emails to your TheMail account (again, you can do this over the phone. 
You do not have to be at a computer.)  It does not matter what the emails say,
just as long as you
send something.  OR, if you do not wish to call your voicemail every day, then
just check it once a week, and send 49 emails to your TheMail account.

11.-Now go to http://sendfree.main-page.com and sign up with their free opt-in
email list program. Upon setting up your account, you will notice that SendFree
will be advertising your autoresponder (Your TheMail address).  There you have
it!  Your autoresponder being advertised, and hundreds to thousands of people
emailing your autoresponder to get this very letter.

12.-At this point, you are just about all set up, and now have the media for
getting this letter out to hundreds to thousands of people. Use your business
cards, email, voicemail, and other ways you can think of to get people to get,
and follow the instructions on this letter.

Get 50 people (or more, if you'd like) to sign up under you in TheMail within a
year. (With http://sendfree.main-page.com this will be a snap.)

13.-Help those 50 people get at least 1 person to sign up under them in their
first month. (ACTUALLY, just as long as those 50 people read this same letter,
you won't have to lift a finger.  It should happen automatically.)

14.-Once every month or two, log into your TheMail email account (remember, you
can do this from a library computer if you do not have internet access) and
delete all of the emails out of your inbox.

15.Set up a Keen.com account!http://www.keen.com/NiteJasmine?ref=1
Not only will this allow you to get more people interested in setting up this
program, but it will also PAY YOU for using their system.. Truely a win/win
situation.

16.-Wow!  You're done!  If you follow all the instructions in this letter, then
you WILL be making $6,792.10+ per month.

For extra money, it is suggested that you go to the following, and subscribe to
their newsletters.  When you subscribe, make sure to give them your THEMAIL
account, NOT your OneBox account:

AND REMEMBER:

Now that you are set up, your main function is step #10:

"Every day, call your voicemail to listen to your emails, voicemails, and faxes
(yes, ALL of this can be listened to over the phone.  You do not have to log on
to the internet to hear your emails, etc.)  After you are done listening, send 7
emails to your TheMail account (again, you can do this over the phone.  You do
not have to be at a computer.)  It does not matter what the emails say, just as
long as you send something.  OR, if you do not wish to call your voicemail every
day, then just check it once a week, and send 49 emails to your TheMail
account."
