Thursday, 2 november 2000 : It is by now possible to set up a community =
site free of charge and in just a few minutes.

Home : www.gateyourself.com=20

Create your own site : www.gateyourself.com

Contact : Clement Colliard press@gateyourself.com

Many Internet users would like to have their own directory, run their =
own Forum, circulate articles or present a photo-album. We all of us =
wish at one time or another to swap our hobbying skills, spread our =
knowledge on some subject that we know well or react publicly to an =
event that concerns us. To do so those of us who have mastered the HTML =
code have often spent long hours in setting up their personal site. But =
the vast majority of web users is far from mastering these techniques =
and so must resign themselves to being just a 'surfer'.



What is GATEYOURSELF?

From today on, all Internet users are enabled to set up their own =
Community Site without the need for any particular expertise. In just a =
few minutes they can avail of:

  a.. Their own URL=20
  b.. Their Forum=20
  c.. Their Directory=20
  d.. Their Chronicle=20
  e.. Their Photo-album=20
  f.. Their Chat=20
Each of these Community Sites can welcome members who will participate =
in the content or structure of the site. To facilitate the organisation =
of these interactivities, various modules are available:

  a.. Management of users (list of Members and rights of access)=20
  b.. User groups (management of users by interest group or by role)=20
  c.. Bulletin boards (posting of messages to site Members)=20
  d.. Site frequentation statistics=20
Finally, to personalise their site, web users can modify at will:

  a.. The colours=20
  b.. Fonts=20
  c.. Layout of information=20
  d.. Their logos and background image=20
All this is easy to use and can quickly be put in place. In effect, =
there is only one way to convince yourself of this : create your own =
Community Site (www.gateyourself.com/signup).=20



Maximum interactivity

Additional to these services GATEYOURSELF provides an effective means to =
interact with web users since each Community Site is optimised for =
search engines and inscribed on their databases. In the same spirit, the =
www.gateyourself.com basic portal presents a directory of all Community =
Sites and classification of the more visited sites.

This general public service bears the evocative name of GATEYOURSELF. =
Otherwise expressed, "Become your own gate". Over the months of =
September and October 2000, GATEYOURSELF has been tried out by some 100 =
Internet users of different socio-educational backgrounds. The =
interactivity and simplicity of use have been among the more highly =
appreciated features offered by the System.=20



Business facts

GATEYOURSELF is financed by on-line advertising and is entirely free of =
charge for its users. It is designed for private persons of all ages and =
associations but also for enterprises. In the coming weeks two further =
versions of GATEYOURSELF will be marketed :

  a.. GATEYOURSELF no banner : which will offer the same services but =
without advertising on the various pages of the site. Marketing will be =
carried out under the form of quarterly subscriptions and it will be =
possible to host a domain name. The cost will be around $ 15 - 30.=20
  b.. GATEYOURSELF intranet : which will enable an enterprise or a group =
to utilise the facilities of the system independently, internally and in =
a personalised manner. Available under the form of a wholly pre-set =
server, GATEYOURSELF intranet will cost between $ 10,000 - 25,000.=20
GATEYOURSELF will generate between 200,000 and 500,000 pageviews per =
month from the time of its launching thanks to the use of NODUS traffic =
generators and a banner campaign developed in partnership with 24/7 =
Media Europe. This latter body has also been chosen by GATEYOURSELF for =
the management of its advertising spaces. GATEYOURSELF aims to achieve a =
target of 2000 community sites and 1,000,000 pageviews between now and =
March 2001. 7000 sites and 4,000,000 pageviews are envisaged for October =
2001.

pervading all spheres of Western industrial society can be remedied only 
by a change in our world view.  We shall have to shift from the materialistic,
dualistic belief that people and their environment are separate, toward a
new conciousness of an all-encompassing reality, which embraces the 
experiencing ego, a reality in which people feel their oneness with animate 
nature and all of creation.
- Dr. Albert Hoffman
