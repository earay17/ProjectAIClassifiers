Just in time for Christmas!

Dear Friend, 

This letter is about an opportunity to make an incredible amount of Money ( CASH !!!) in a very short time. You have received this letter in time to get your money started coming in time for Christmas. The cost is only $6.00! This is the 16th day since I started receiving $ cash, and so far I have received $5,845 (in $1 Bills)...so I guess this is really working! Give it a try!

All I did was follow the instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent out some e-mail to people who responded to my ads.
Here is a testimony from one of the thousands who have benefited from this simple investment plan.

"I'm a retired attorney, and about a year ago a man came to me with a letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before you now. He asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told him that I would review it and get back to him. When I first read the letter, I thought it was some off the wall idea to make money. A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue. I told him that the letter would be all right. I was curious about the letter, so he told me how it worked. I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against participating. Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to his results. About two months later he called me to tell me that he had received more than $800,000.00 in cash! I didn't believe him. So he asked me to try the plan and see for myself."

"I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was not much to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and mailed out 200 letters. Sure enough the money started oming in! It came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more than I could open in a day. After three months the money stopped coming. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it totalled $868,439.00. I earn a good living as an attorney, but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of stress that comes with the territory. I decided if things worked out, I would retire from practice and play golf. This time I sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had totalled $2,344,178.00."

"I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works. He told me that there were a few similar letters going around. What made this one different is the fact that there were six names on the letter, not three like most others. That act alone resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no one wants to risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are curious about what little changes I told him to make. Well, if you send a letter like this one, to be legal, you must sell something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that anyone sending a dollar must received something in RETURN. So when you send a dollar to each of the six names on the list, you must include a slip of paper saying, "Please add me to your mailing list" and include your name and mailing address. This is the key to the program. The item you will receive for your dollar sent, is THIS letter and the right to earn thousands."

Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three months you should receive MORE THAN $800,000.00 IN COLD HARD CASH!


1) IMMEDIATELY send $1.00 (US$) to each of the six people listed below. 
THE SOONER YOU SEND THE "$1.00 LETTERS" THE SOONER YOU CAN 
START GETTING A RETURN! Wrap the dollar in a note saying 
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST".

1. W. Williamson 310 Cain Ridge Rd #J3, Vicksburg, Ms 39180

2. Mavis Marshall 5760 Nailor Rd. Vicksburg, MS 39180

3.  Judy Speights, 3003 Hwy 43 S., Silver Creek, MS 39663

5. R. Turner 921 Bernadette, Sulphur, LA 70663

6. D. Barnes P. O. Box 910, Deer Park, TX 77536


2) REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to #1 at the top of the list and 
move the rest of the names UP one position. Then place YOUR name in the # 6 spot. This is best done by saving this to a file and entering your information on line # 6. Be careful when you type the addresses. Don't forget to PROOF-READ them. Make SURE that the names and addresses are correct. 


3) When you have COMPLETED the above instructions, you have several options on how you market the letter - through the Postal Service, through E-mail, through posting in "FREE CLASSIFIED ADS" and "NEWSGROUPS" ON THE INTERNET, or through whatever way you think is most effective.
To send this letter out to thousands of people and increase your profits, I suggest you use a Bulk E-mail company. Call 281-542-5358 to have your letter e-mailed to 100,000 people for you. They are fast, effective and give excellent service. 100,000 emailings costs just $99.00, and they are running a special now of 10,000 additional mailings FREE through  December 18, 2000, so hurry!!!

This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above as long as you follow the instructions, because you are purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list. The more you send out, the more YOU will make. We strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family, friends, and relatives as well.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL. (Refer to title 18, section 1302 &1341 of the US Postal and Lottery Laws)

Assume for example you get a 8% return rate.
1) When you mail out 200 letters, ONLY 16 people send you $1.00

2) Those 16 people mail out 200 letters, (3200 letters) and ONLY 256 people send you $1.00

3) Those 256 people mail out 200 letters, (51,200 letters) and ONLY 4,096 people send you $1.00

4) Those 4,096 people mail out 200 letters (812,200 letter) and ONLY 65,536 people send you $1.00

5) Those 69,536 people mail out 200 letters (13,107,200 letters) and ONLY 1,048,576 people send you $1.00. 

At the Next level your name-drops off the list.

Think about it. Look what you WILL have BEFORE your name-drops off the list! I know this looks and sounds unbelievable. Just try it, and you will be happy that you did because you will receive proof when THOUSANDS of ONE-DOLLAR BILLS start to pile up!

***MAKE SURE you send One US dollar to each of the six names on the list. 
(This is VERY IMPORTANT), with a note saying
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST"

This letter will only work if you follow instructions correctly. Please mail each of the 6 people One US Dollar wrapped in a piece of paper with the note: ’Please add me to your mailing list’ and then take No.1 off, move No.2 - No.6 up one and add your name in the No. 6 Slot. That’s it. 

P.S. You've read this far, so let me ask you one simple question,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?

Even with a 1% return you will still get $100,000.00 in 90 DAYS!!! What you can gain is an income, like the example in this letter. You will have a very small expense, but you will reap HUGE potential returns. What do you have to lose? I invite you to JOIN our mailing list RIGHT NOW!

Thank you for your time. GOOD LUCK & BEST WISHES TO YOU !!!
