SMART MARKETING TIPS NEWSLETTER


S-M-T Tip #1:  Get TOP RANKING on the major search engines, guaranteed.

                      Our search engine promotion service extends far beyond
                      typical "submit" and "report" services that don't get results.
                      We take the time and energy to study keyword popularity
                      and analyze competition in your industry.  We run extensive
                      analytics on your website and report to you recommendations
                      for making your site conducive to the big engines.  Only then
                      do we submit, monitor, tweak, and re-submit if necessary
                      to the major search engines and directories.

                      This way we can guarantee top 30 placement on any of the
                      10 most popular search engines, a guarantee to beat your
                      competition.

S-M-T Tip #2:  Get Interactive WITHOUT fully re-designing your website.

                      Re-fitting your website to FLASH or any other of the
                      animation technologies is expensive, very expensive.
                      Introduce a INTERACTIVE ADVERTISEMENT for a fraction
                      of the cost, and get the high-impact animation your website
                      needs to stay competitive.

S-M-T Tip #3:  Pay less by hosting here in Canada.

                      Don't fight the exchange rates south of the border, win the war
                      by hosting your site in our state-of-the-art Data Centre located
                      in Vancouver, BC.

                      With hosting packages that start at just $9.95 CDN, combined
                      with our 99.8% uptime guarantee, you can be assured that you
                      are not overpaying for your hosting services.
