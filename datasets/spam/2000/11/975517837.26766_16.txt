Dear Friend;

In conjunction with the United States Marine Corp and the Toys for Tots
Foundation I am asking for your support in helping a child this
Christmas.  The Toys for Tots Foundation raises funds to purchase toys
for needy children. 

We have selected a few people like yourself to help us spread the word
about the Toys for Tots fundraising program. We would like to give you a
free membership for GaZoom.com.  In return, all we ask is that you make
a "best effort" to refer your friends or family to the Toys for Tots
campaign web site at http://www.helptoysfortots.com 

A GaZoom.com membership normally costs twenty dollars with half the
proceeds going to charity.  Your free membership entitles you to a years
worth of Incredible Deals and the knowledge that you are helping out a
child this Christmas.  To receive your free GaZoom.com membership please
click on url http://www.gazoom.com/toysfortots

Best wishes for a happy holiday season


John F. Marshall
