Dear Reader, 

Approximately 6 years ago I received and read a book that came unsolicited in my mail box.  I was very skeptical but there was a sincerity to the words I read so I decided to look into it further. I had been looking for an opportunity to make a change in my life. My reason "why" was because 9 years ago my wife and I had a second child who was born with serious heart defect. 

Sloane was 8 months old when she died in my arms October 28, 1991. Her birth and subsequent death changed my life and the lives of my wife and son forever. I learned a hard lesson in that all the money in the world is meaningless if you don't have your health, family and spiritual connection in place.

The CEO of the computer software company I worked for at the time called me 2 weeks after the loss of my child and told me I was being relocated to Houston, TX on a job promotion. I had to be there in 10 days! When I turned the promotion down because my wife and I needed to stay put and continue on with our grief counseling, I was told that I was being disloyal to him and the company. I realized then that if you don't own your own company, you don't have control over your financial security.

6 years ago I acted upon what I read. My wife and I now enjoy a six-figure income which is growing while we work from home around our family's schedule.

If it's the right time to make a  change in your life, please take the time to call the phone number shown below and take what you hear seriously.  Thank God I did or my life would be totally different today!  Whatever you decide, here's wishing you and your family a happy, healthy, holiday season!
