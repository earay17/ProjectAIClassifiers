Dear Windows User, 
 
Now you can boost the reliability of ordinary Windows 95, 98 and ME, to 
nearly the level of Windows NT or 2000, Microsoft's professional and industrial 
version of Windows. 
 
The new WinFix 4.4 is a very effective way to improve the reliability of 
Windows, because it makes Windows fault-tolerant and self-repairing. And 
WinFix is very safe, because it operates completely independent of 
Windows. 
 
Visit  http://www.rniureo17.com/comph   to find out more about WinFix, the 
safest, most effective way to keep you working, by keeping your PC 
working non-stop.
