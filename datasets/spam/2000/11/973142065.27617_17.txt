ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!

STRONG BUY RECOMMENDATION!!

THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO EXPLODE IN THE NEXT 
48 HOURS.  
DO NOT HESITATE.  
WALL STREET ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS 
STOCK MAY TRIPLE OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS!!!

Infotpoia (OTCBB symbol "IFTP") is a dramatic start up 
that is just emerging. The company has used great 
ingenuity to put together a series of products sold 
through infomercials, media, Internet and retail so that 
it has become a $40 million dollar enterprise almost 
overnight. 
IFTP will complete its first full year of operation in 
February 2001. 
Sales for the year should exceed $20 million.

This is a serious buying opportunity.
