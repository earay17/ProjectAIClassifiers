Dear Online Marketer,


I recently sent you information about our business opportunity. I thought I would share 
my personal experience in the program so you will make a well informed decision. 

Again, if you don't wish to have any further information from me, just reply to this E-
mail and put 'remove' in the subject line.  If you have not requested any information, 
you may need to E-mail the E-mail centre and ask to be removed off their lists. 

My name is Joanne. I joined the company about 6 months ago and it has been a great 
experience for me. This business eliminated all the hassles of the other MLM companies, 
by giving me FREE tools I needed to succeed, by helping me to build my downline with 
the trademark Online Recruiter. The pressure of having to find people to sponsor was 
gone. I could do nothing and my business would grow, but with a little effort it could 
explode. 
This is not something that happened to me ten years ago and now you are getting my 
success story. This is a business that I have just been involved with for the past 6 
months and it has already exceeded all my expectations! This company has married 
three of the hottest trends: Internet, Natural Wellness and MLM. The technology 
breakthrough of the Internet has finally made MLM feasible and hassle free. It can 
happen. The technology is there. 

If you would like further information  you can simpy reply to this E-mail with 
'information' in the subject line.  I will get back to you with all the details you need to 
make a totally informed decision about this business.
Remember we also offer 30 days money back guarantee. 

The risk is none. 
Regards, 
Joanne Gutteridge 


I have no intention of spamming, and only send you this information on the
