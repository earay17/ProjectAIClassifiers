If you PAY to use the Internet,  you will want to Read this:

The Most Exciting Opportunity has hit the Net, a program geared for
every Man, Woman & Child.   =20


If you use an Internet Service Provider,  then this definitely concerns =
you.

A new Internet Community is about to launch.  (like AOL)

JOIN NOW!!

http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/selepackl

What most Internet users don't realize is that from the moment you log =
on
until the moment you log off you are generating a good deal of cash for
someone else, even if you do not buy or fill out anything!

Well, Going Platinum is going to share that wealth with us!!!

Competition on the Internet has grown to the point that web-based =
companies
are paying sizable "referral fees" and "commissions" to the ISP =
(Internet
Service Provider), Portal, Search Engine, or even the personal web page
owner that directs you to their site. If you happen to buy something,
provide a little information, or take advantage of a useful service, the
money changing hands is that much greater.

Whether it's a big banner advertisement or a simple highlighted text =
link, if you
clicked on it or even just viewed it, that web page owner is more than
likely cashing in. Some of the larger ISPs make so much money from these
advertisements and links, it is almost unimaginable that they also =
charge you
a monthly fee for the privilege of allowing them to be your Internet
gateway.

This is not a Pay to SURF program, you will not have to deal with =
Viewbars.

Your membership in Going Platinum will change your view of the Internet
forever by enabling you to profit from it whether you are online or not.

Membership in Going Platinum affords you the opportunity to earn money
through 2 uniquely different, yet related programs:

FREE-------The GPC (Going Platinum Community) is a cooperative online
community that pays you the "referral fees" and "commissions" that you =
and
your friends' presence on the Internet generate. It is designed to turn
every Internet session into an income-producing event.

$25.00-----The GPAP (Going Platinum Affiliate Program) is our dynamic
membership plan that pays you just for participating. It also helps you =
to
earn much, much more in the GPC even if you play the most passive of =
roles
in the program. If you sign up and do nothing else, the GPAP is for you.
Paying to join GPAP is for a limited time only, this feature will soon =
be
gone.
This is for our membership drive.

Once you join the GPAP, you will benefit from Upline Spillover, and
Spillover from people signing up from the Corporate site.

Spillover means that you benefit from other people's efforts by them =
placing people in your downline, which is also their downline. This may =
come from the corporate site, or referrals from people that joined =
before you.


BRAND NEW, Join Today and Be in at the TOP!!!!!

http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/selepackl


IF YOU NEVER JOIN ANOTHER PROGRAM - YOU OWE IT TO
YOURSELF TO AT LEAST LOOK AT THIS ONE!!!!

FACT:  GOING PLATINUM is the #1 Opp. Online...There is NO other program =
that
even comes close. .

WHY?  Well, if YOU join NOW, you could become seriously wealthy!  And =
they haven't even launched phase 1 yet!!!

Some people are already earning a monthly income from joining the GPAP. =
And
they haven't even done anything. Finally a program for everyone, from =
the
most aggresive marketers, to the most passive users.
People  just want a ISP that makes sense.

It is estimated that Going Platinum
will gain 10,000,000 members within the next six months.
But, that just might be an UNDER-ESTIMATE!
LOOK - Total membership in just four weeks is over
50,000! This program is the hottest thing on the Internet
and it hasn't even launched Phase I.

Membership is RISK-FREE. There is a lifetime, no questions
asked, money back guarantee.

With membership projected to be 10 million within 6-8
months, you don't want to be left on the sidelines when
this happens. Don't we wish we had had the foresight to
join AOL during it's pre-launch?

JOIN NOW!!

http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/selepackl=20

You can join for FREE or you can pay a one-time fee of Twenty-five =
dollars
and begin earning from BOTH your personally sponsored members AND your
community's spillover! Sign up NOW before the company begins the BIG
advertising blitz. People will be joining through the corporate site, =
which
means spillover for GPAP members only.

You can Join us,  and never do another thing,  or work a little and go =
PLATINUM !! =20
Either way you can be glad you chose a hardworking Team, a Team that =20
gives you 150% of their Time and Effort.

Join Today, we all want to increase our NETWORTH
