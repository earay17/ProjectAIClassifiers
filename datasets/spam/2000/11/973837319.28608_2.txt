I no longer work for anyone else because I am being paid handsomely by 
several solid, passive (no recruiting, no sales, no products), very 
high-yield investment programs.  For a brief summary of these, simply 
reply to F8thdriven@yahoo.com with "PLEASE SEND INFO" as the subject.  
You will receive no hype, just facts on programs that are paying me 
20%-50% per month on a regular basis, many having very low entry levels.

God Bless,
