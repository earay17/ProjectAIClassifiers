This is a Communication Forum for injured workers and professionals.


NSPIWA.INTRANETS.COM

The prime objective is to assist injured workers to proper representation
even if they must do it themselves.
 
This Location allows all injured workers a form to further the cause
of the Great Injustice Done To The Injured Worker By A System That
Destroys His Rights by fitting a powerful bureaucracy to change policy
every time a decision is made by an officer of the court and fitting
a different medical opinion against highly credentialed Medical Professionals.
Opinions professionally diagnosing showing detailed medical problems,
these opinions are being overruled in such a volume surely there
must be action to bring these doctors accountable to there governing
bodies for such blatant disregard to misrepresent the injured workers
injuries.
How are we to get your support to speak out for the injured worker?

Don't stack the deck against a defenceless injured worker who goes
to his doctor to get a professional assessment he is asked Do You
Want The $200 Dollar Assessment The $600 Dollar Assessment Or The
$800 Dollar Assessment.
I had asked previously for your support.
We ask you to have all injured workers contact us online at NSPIWA.INTRANET.COM

An intranet is like a private website -- only people who join can
see what's there. We can use the site to share files, pictures, and
links, coordinate events, and keep everyone up-to-date on important
group announcements. You don't need anything special to connect to
the site; just a web browser and an Internet connection. But you
do need to sign up to become a member. 

Here's how to join... 

     1. Go to http://nspiwa.intranets.com/register_member.asp
     2. Fill out the information on the new member form using the
Registration Code: 279115
     3. That's it!

Just make sure that when you enter the Registration Code, you type
it just like it's shown above because it is case-sensitive. Also,
be sure to keep the Registration Code private because anyone who
knows it can join the intranet.
