AMERICANS: BreakFree from Government Control/Interference!
======================================================
The GOVERNMENT thinks it OWNS you! 
It thinks YOU are its PROPERTY!

You can BREAK their grip on you, and TAKE CONTROL of 
yourself and your property (including earnings) -- so 
they can NEVER confiscate ANY of it, ever again! You 
can learn how to:

* FORCE the IRS to pay any tax liabilities FOR you!
* HALT Mortgage Foreclosures!
* STOP Credit Card liens!
* KILL Lawsuits!
* TAKE CONTROL of any trial and force the Judge to give 
  YOU the Order of the Court.
* and, much, much more!

Take CHARGE and turn EVERYTHING they use to come against 
you -- AROUND -- and make it work against THEM! Learn 
how to take control and power over your life (and those 
who would come in opposition against you) in ways that 
you've never even dreamed about.

To learn more, put "BreakFree" in the Subject.
