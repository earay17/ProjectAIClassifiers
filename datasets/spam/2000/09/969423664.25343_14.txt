Subject: DO NOT take credit cards!                         14174

You don't have to be able to accept credit cards to do
 on-line commerce or to accept payments by phone or fax,
 nor do you need to go through any application process
 or be approved by anyone; and you don't need expensive
 online banking to automate your monthly bills! 

You are much better off when customers pay by check instead
 of credit card. They can not reverse a check after it clears
 and your bad checks will never even come close to the 3% or
 more you will pay on every credit card sale. Checks are
 safer for your customers to use since they must be deposited
 into someone's checking account, leaving an easy trail to
 follow in the event of fraud.

Any business or individual can accept checks starting today
 by phone or fax or Email or from a web site. No approval is
 needed from your bank or anyone else.

All you need is the software to print the checks and to print
 the MICR coded numbers at the bottom plus some official
 looking check paper to print on. An initial supply of paper -
 enough for 375 checks is included with the software.

Your only upfront cost is the cost of the software and your
 only ongoing cost is 1 to 5 cents per check for the paper.

Our software will also automate your monthly bill paying and
 allow you to print blank checks to use with any checking
 accounts. You can also do automatic withdrawals from the
 bank accounts of any customers who pay you monthly.

On-line businesses can accept checks via Email or right on a
 web site and import those checks automatically into our
 software without typing. 

Here's the process...
-you get checking account information from your customers by
 phone, fax, Email or from a web site
-you import or type that information into your new check
 printing software
-you print out the checks one at a time or in batches - any
 printer will work. The printed checks are actually "drafts".
 They to not require a signature and are accepted by all banks.
-you go to the bank and deposit the drafts

The regular version will not import checks from Email or a web
 site; will not automate monthly bill paying; will not handle
 recurring payments from "monthly" customers; and will not
 produce a variety of printed and displayed reports by payee
 and/or payor for a single date or a range of dates,
 but the PRO version will do it all.

Our regular version sells for $49.95 and our PRO version for
 $149.95, but we are making a special offer ONLY to those who
 buy through this Email. You can get the PRO version for LESS
 than the price of the regular version. For one week only, we 
 are offering the PRO version of our software by Email only for
 the unheard of price of only $39.95 and that includes $20 worth
 of official check paper and free shipping in the USA. Add $5
 outside the USA. You get enough paper for 375 checks.

This software includes several options for resale rights. They
 are explained within the software itself and you can contact
 the author (not us) for more information. You can make money
 re-selling this software and no investment is required other
 than this purchase of a copy of the software.

This is one of the best known check printing software packages
 on the market and we are the first ever to offer the PRO version
 at this price. The lowest price ever offered before was a half
 price $50 PRO upgrade offer to those who had already purchased the
 regular version. The normal PRO upgrade price is $100. The regular
 version has NEVER been offered for less than the regular price of
 $49.95 and probably never will be. This is a bulk Email offer only
 and will never be repeated elsewhere.

Here is what users are saying to the author of this software...

Howard... your software is BY FAR the simplest check-by-phone
 program I have seen, and EVERYONE I have sold it to says exactly
 the same thing! Thanks for writing such a user friendly program!

Lilian... got the form to work! It's great! I love it! I got
 2 real on-line checks today and what a difference! It even put the
 ebay item# on the Memo!

Bruce... just wanted to take a minute to thank you for your
 software program. Since we purchased it in 1998 it has become the
 mainstay of our accounts receivable billing. The ability to produce
 pre-authorized checks insures on time payments every time and saves
 us countless hours of invoicing. We had tried other so called check
 programs before but yours is the hands down winner. Thanks again and
 keep up the good work.

Terry... Thank you for such a perfect piece of software work!
 This has been the biggest single market advantage additive to my
 business in the past decade. I really appreciate your efforts.

Helen...Thanks you so much for getting back to me.  You are one of
 the few who take the time to deal with your clients so promptly.

To order, just print then fill out and sign the following form
 and fax it to: 214-853-5017 - you can also leave a voice message
 at that number. If you don't get a confirming Email within 2
 business days, please assume that our fax dropped your order and
 call and leave a voice message.

When we get your order, we will use our software to print a draft
 on your account for exactly $39.95. We take a couple of days to
 verify funds and that you gave us a correct account number, then
 without waiting for the check to clear, we ship your paper and
 software. You will be printing checks in less than a week.
