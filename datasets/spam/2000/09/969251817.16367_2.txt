Hi,

My name is Samantha Jones.  My friends call me
Sam.

This is not intended to be spam.  Rather, it 
is an appeal for help. If you can't, or don't 
want to help, simply do nothing.  This is the 
only email you'll receive from me.  However, 
if you REALLY want to make sure I won't email
you again, simply click on REPLY, type REMOVE 
in the Subject Line and SEND.

Now to the reason for this message.

I am a 65 year old woman who needs to earn an 
additional $1,360 per month to remain solvent.
At present, I have only a small retirement income
and social security.  It is not enough to live on, as
you can probably surmise.

My health prevents me from holding an outside job
and, I believe my best hope is in earning money on 
the Web.  I am not dumb or lazy and have spent 
(actually borrowed from my credit cards, which has 
finally caught up with me) significant money on 
programs and tools.  None of the programs have 
worked - at least not for me.  Some of the software 
seems quite good for delivering and responding to 
messages - for the time when I find a program that actually 
works - not the vaporware I receive in my inbox daily.

Can you recommend a program that offers a good value
to the buyer (not one that just tells me how to make 
money) through which YOU have actually earned a 
significant ($500 or more per month) income on a regular
basis?

If yes, will you tell me about it?  If yes, will you be willing
to share your information and experience with others on
a newly forming Forum to help people like myself earn
an honest income on the Web?

If  desirous of joining the Forum, please REPLY with the word 
FORUM in the Subject Line.  If you also have info on a
program, product or service from which you earn monthly
income, please REPLY with the word FORUM + in the
Subject Line.  The "+" shows you have info that has made
you money.

Thank you,

Sam
