Never Pay Income Tax Again!

Which would you rather do: continue to pour your money down
the Federal rat-hole, or learn how to keep it for yourself
and put it to work? That legal choice is yours, right now!

We can teach you how never to pay Federal Income Tax again.
If you're self-employed, we can teach you how never to pay
"Social Security" Tax again. If your State taxes income, we
can teach you how never to pay State Income Tax again.

Check the "total tax" amount you wrote on Line 56 of your
most recent 1040 Form. Even if you never earn more than you
did then, that sum is the least you can save, every year
from now on. All you need do is to do what we can teach you.
 
We can teach you why that's not only fabulous for you, but 
a very good thing for the country too.  
 
Perhaps you thought there was no legal way you could do
those things - but we can teach you not just one but *three
or four* ways! You'll meet in person the experts who have
developed these strategies, and choose the method that suits
you best. It's like feasting from a financial smorgasbord!  

        And even all that is only just the start.  
 
We can teach you how to recover privacy. Did you know that
in 1999, government nearly made your banker report every
transaction on your account that seems "unusual"? - and that
even though protests supposedly buried "Know Your Customer",
88% of banks are busy implementing most of it anyway? And did
you know that the government's "Echelon" system scans every
e-mail you send out, looking for "suspicious" word groups?

We can teach you how to protect your assets - from litigants
and snoops and death-taxers and probate lawyers.

We can teach you how to find investment vehicles with yield
percentages *several times higher* than comparably-safe ones
advertised generally. That can lead quickly to a huge, safe,
private FAMILY FORTUNE.

We can teach you how and why doing such things is important;
to understand what's really been going on around us. And so,
we can teach you to become free as well as wealthy.

AND IN ADDITION, THERE'S A GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY; we can 
teach you how to make some excellent profits, if you wish, by 
sharing what you learned. No fancy arithmetic, no MLM shell-
game, just honest retailing of a value-packed product.

That is what we can teach you. If you're ready to learn any
of those things, please put "Never Pay Tax Info" as the
subject.
