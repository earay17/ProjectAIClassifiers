Dear News Reporter,

The high-score database containing the official world records for video game and pinball 

playing is now available on the Internet as a free reference source.

It can be found by clicking on SEARCH SCORES at: 
http://www.twingalaxies.com

This body of information is essentially the statistical history of video game and pinball 

playing from 1977 to present and has already been used as a reference source by many news 

agencies and Hollywood producers, including the Guinness Book of World Records, ABC-TV’s 

That’s Incredible and Jeopardy, the TV game show. In the next month, this data will be 

supplemented with 15,000 further high scores which represent the new world records on 

today's current game titles.

If this announcement has reached your desk in error, we’ll remove you from our contact list. 

Please hit reply and paste REMOVE in the subject field and send us back an email.
