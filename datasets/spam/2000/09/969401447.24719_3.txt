<BR>
Hello - <BR>
My name is Johnathon Rourke; I'm from Rhode Island. The enclosed <BR>
information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. <BR>
Fortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought <BR>
and study to it. Two years ago, the corporation I worked for the past <BR>
twelve years downsized and my position was eliminated. After <BR>
unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over <BR>
the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my <BR>
family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a <BR>
toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had <BR>
to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and <BR>
struggling business.<BR>
<BR>
AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life. I am writing <BR>
to share the experience in hopes that this could change your life <BR>
FOREVER FINANCIALLY$$$!!!<BR>
<BR>
In mid December, I received this program in my e-mail. Six months prior <BR>
to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on <BR>
various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my <BR>
opinion, were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me <BR>
to comprehend, or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to <BR>
see if they would work.<BR>
<BR>
But as I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I <BR>
didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing <BR>
list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to <BR>
make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes! Here <BR>
was a MONEY MAKING MACHINE I could start immediately without any debt.<BR>
<BR>
Like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried <BR>
about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. <BR>
Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is <BR>
indeed legal! After determining that the program was LEGAL I decided <BR>
"WHY NOT"?!?!<BR>
<BR>
Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time <BR>
on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any for <BR>
printing to send out the program, and because I also send the product <BR>
(reports) by e-mail, my only expense is my time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. <BR>
By January 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to <BR>
"RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU <BR>
DON'T, <BR>
SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.<BR>
<BR>
My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By January 30, I <BR>
had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to "RECEIVE AT <BR>
LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND <BR>
OUT MORE <BR>
PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST <BR>
IS EASY, <BR>
RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL."<BR>
<BR>
Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2. 96 more than I needed. So I sat <BR>
back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received <BR>
$58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and <BR>
bought a much-needed new car!<BR>
<BR>
Please take your time to read this plan, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE <BR>
FOREVER$!!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program <BR>
does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY, especially the rules of not <BR>
trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work and <BR>
you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work, <BR>
you must meet your goal of 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and 100+ orders <BR>
for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days.<BR>
<BR>
I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in <BR>
this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little <BR>
cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program <BR>
and you will be on your way to financial security. If you are a fellow <BR>
business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to <BR>
start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! $$<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>
Johnathon Rourke<BR>

<BR>
A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:<BR>
<BR>
By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should <BR>
have concluded that an amateur could not have created such a program, <BR>
and one that is legal. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a <BR>
profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began <BR>
falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously <BR>
successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It <BR>
wasn't me, it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the <BR>
stable economy that had been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell <BR>
you what happened to the unemployment rate... because many of you know <BR>
from first hand experience.<BR>
<BR>
There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle <BR>
class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested <BR>
wisely and moved up. Those who did not, including those who never had <BR>
anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks of the <BR>
poor. As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET <BR>
POORER." The traditional methods of making money will never allow you <BR>
to "move up" or "get rich", inflation will see to that. You have just <BR>
received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest <BR>
of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT." You can <BR>
make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. I <BR>
should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money, nor <BR>
anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program. I have <BR>
retired from the program after sending thousands and thousands of <BR>
programs.<BR>
<BR>
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. <BR>
It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of <BR>
this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people <BR>
you send this to may send out 50,000... and your name will be on every <BR>
one of them! Remember though, the more you send out, the more potential <BR>
customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, <BR>
information, materials and opportunity to become financially <BR>
independent.<BR>
<BR>
NOW IT IS UP TO YOU TO DO IT!<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
Before you delete this program from your in-box, as I almost did, take <BR>
a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and <BR>
figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst <BR>
possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still <BR>
make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. <BR>
Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in.<BR>
<BR>
$$$ IT WORKS!!! $$$<BR>

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS <BR>
OF <BR>
DOLLAR$$$$!!!!<BR>
<BR>
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure <BR>
that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before <BR>
you say, "BULL... " please read this program carefully. This is not a <BR>
chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making business.<BR>
<BR>
As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting <BR>
new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows <BR>
you to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we sell and <BR>
deliver a product for EVERY dollar received. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL <BR>
AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. <BR>
You do it privately in your own home, store or office. This is the <BR>
EASIEST marketing plan anywhere! It is simply order filling by email!<BR>

<BR>
The product is informational and instructional material containing the <BR>
secrets on how to open the doors to the magic world of E-COMMERCE , the <BR>
information highway, the wave of the future!<BR>
<BR>
PLAN SUMMARY:<BR>
(1) You order the 4 reports listed below ($5 each) which come to you by <BR>
email.<BR>
<BR>
(2) Save a copy of this entire letter and put your name after Report #1 <BR>
and move the other names down.<BR>
<BR>
(3) Access Yahoo.com or any of the other major search engines to locate <BR>
hundreds of bulk email service companies (search for "bulk email") and <BR>
have them send 25,000 - 50,000 emails for you (about $49+)<BR>
<BR>
(4) Orders will come to you by postal mail - simply email them the <BR>
report they ordered.<BR>
<BR>
Let me ask you - isn't this about as easy as it gets?<BR>
<BR>
****************************************************************<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
By the way there are over 50 MILLION email addresses with millions more <BR>
joining the internet each year so don't worry about "running out" or <BR>
"saturation". People are used to seeing and hearing the same <BR>
advertisements every day on radio/TV. How many times have you received <BR>
the same pizza flyers on your door? Then one day you are hungry for <BR>
pizza and you order one. Same thing with this letter. I received this <BR>
letter many times - then one day I decided it was time to try it.<BR>
<BR>
****************************************************************<BR>
***<BR>
<BR>
YOU CAN START TODAY - JUST DO THESE EASY STEPS:<BR>
<BR>
STEP #1: ORDER THE FOUR REPORTS<BR>
<BR>
Order the four reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if <BR>
you don't order them). -- For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & <BR>
NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL <BR>
ADDRESS, and YOUR <BR>
NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person whose name <BR>
appears on the list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS <BR>
IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!<BR>
<BR>
Within a few days you will receive, by e-mail, each of the four <BR>
reports. Save them on your computer so you can send them to the 1,000's <BR>
of people who will order them from you.<BR>
<BR>
STEP #2: ADD YOUR MAILING ADDRESS TO THIS LETTER<BR>
a. Look below for the listing of the four reports.<BR>
<BR>
b. After you've ordered the four reports, delete the name and address <BR>
under REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle. <BR>
<BR>
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.<BR>
<BR>
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.<BR>
<BR>
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.<BR>
<BR>
f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.<BR>
<BR>
Please make sure you COPY ALL INFORMATION, every name and address, <BR>
ACCURATELY!<BR>
<BR>
STEP #3: Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, <BR>
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to these instructions. <BR>
Now you are ready to use this entire email to send by email to <BR>
prospects.<BR>
<BR>
Report #1 will tell you how to download bulk email software and email <BR>
addresses so you can send it out to thousands of people while you <BR>
sleep! Remember that 50,000+ new people are joining the Internet every <BR>
month. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely <BR>
you can afford $20 and initial bulk mailing cost). You obviously <BR>
already have a computer and an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!<BR>
<BR>
There are two primary methods of building your down-line:<BR>
<BR>
METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start <BR>
small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those <BR>
involved email out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the <BR>
mailing receives a 0.5% response. The response could be much better. <BR>
Also, many people will email out hundreds of thousands of programs <BR>
instead of 2,000 (Why stop at 2000?). But continuing with this example, <BR>
you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 <BR>
orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 <BR>
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people <BR>
respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for <BR>
a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for <BR>
REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 <BR>
total. The 0.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4. That's <BR>
10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!!<BR>
<BR>
Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for <BR>
a total of $55,550!!!<BR>
<BR>
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 <BR>
PEOPLE YOU <BR>
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS <BR>
PROGRAM! DARE TO <BR>
THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR <BR>
HALF SENT OUT <BR>
100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just <BR>
that, and more!<BR>
<BR>
METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET<BR>
<BR>
Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive, and there are <BR>
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start <BR>
small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 <BR>
people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads <BR>
on the Internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that <BR>
everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 down-line members. <BR>
Look <BR>
how this small number accumulates to achieve the STAGGERING results <BR>
below:<BR>
<BR>
1st level--your first 10 send you $5................................$50<BR>
<BR>
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100).............$500<BR>
<BR>
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)........$5,000<BR>
<BR>
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)..$50,000<BR>
<BR>
$$$$$$ THIS TOTALS ----------$55,550 $$$$$$<BR>
<BR>
AMAZING ISN'T IT? Remember friends, this assumes that the people who <BR>
participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would <BR>
happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of <BR>
participants and many will continue to work this program, sending out <BR>
programs WITH YOUR NAME ON THEM for years! THINK ABOUT IT!<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
People are going to get emails about this plan from you or somebody <BR>
else and many will work this plan - the question is - Don't you want <BR>
your name to be on the emails they will send out?<BR>
<BR>
* * * DON'T MISS OUT!!! * * * JUST TRY IT ONCE!!! * * *<BR>
<BR>
* * SEE WHAT HAPPENS!!! *** YOU'LL BE AMAZED!!!* *<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!<BR>
<BR>
This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and <BR>
address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they <BR>
receive the report!<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
<BR>
GET STARTED TODAY: PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THE FOUR REPORTS <BR>
NOW.<BR>
<BR>
Notes: -- ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. <BR>
CHECKS <BR>
NOT ACCEPTED. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in two <BR>
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper write: (a) the number <BR>
& name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) <BR>
your name & postal address.<BR>

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******<BR>
<BR>
TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the <BR>
directions accurately. -- Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you <BR>
will have them when the orders start coming in because: When you <BR>
receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. It <BR>
is required for this to be a legal business and they need the reports <BR>
to send out their letters (with your name on them!) -- ALWAYS PROVIDE <BR>
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. -- Be patient and <BR>
persistent with this program - If you follow the instructions exactly - <BR>
results WILL follow. $$$$<BR>
<BR>
******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******<BR>
<BR>
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: If you don't receive <BR>
20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or <BR>
sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should <BR>
receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue <BR>
advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 <BR>
or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is <BR>
already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS <BR>
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the <BR>
list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK <BR>
of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. <BR>
To generate more income, simply send another batch of e-mails or <BR>
continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no <BR>
limit to the income you will generate from this business! <BR>
<BR>
Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in <BR>
this program. Please answer one question.<BR>
<BR>
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR PRESENT INCOME OR JOB?<BR>
<BR>
If the answer is no, then please look at the following facts about this <BR>
super simple MLM program:<BR>
<BR>
1. NO face to face selling, NO meetings, NO inventory! NO Telephone <BR>
calls, NO big cost to start! Nothing to learn, NO skills needed! <BR>
(Surely you know how to send e-mail?)<BR>
<BR>
2. No equipment to buy - you already have a computer and Internet <BR>
connection - so you have everything you need to fill orders!<BR>
<BR>
3. You are selling a product that does NOT COST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE <BR>
OR <BR>
SHIP! (E-mailing copies of the reports is FREE!)<BR>
<BR>
4. All of your customers pay you in CA$H!<BR>
<BR>
This program will change your LIFE FOREVER!! Look at the potential for <BR>
you to be able to quit your job and live a life of luxury you could <BR>
only dream about! Imagine getting out of debt and buying the car and <BR>
home of your dreams and being able to work a super-high paying <BR>
leisurely easy business from home!<BR>
<BR>
$$$ FINALLY MAKE SOME DREAMS COME TRUE! $$$<BR>
<BR>
ACT NOW! Take your first step toward achieving financial independence. <BR>
Order the reports and follow the program outlined above-- SUCCESS will <BR>
be your reward. Thank you for your time and consideration.<BR>
