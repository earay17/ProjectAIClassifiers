<P>Please read all of this bruceg!
<P>A Parent of a 15 year old finds <B><U>$71,000</B></U> cash hidden in her son's closet.
<P>It Works, It's Legal, It's Easy, so Why Not?
<P>Does this headline look familiar?  Of course it does.  You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
<P>His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son's closet.  Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash.  Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.
<P>"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year".
<P>The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered.  He came home right away and they drove together to the boy's school and picked him up.  Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.
<P>As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the Internet a type of "chain-letter" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off of the Internet.  Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.
<P>"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I sent $5 to the three people on the list, I put my name on it like the instructions said and  I started sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.
<P>The E-mail letter listed 3 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to the person at the top of the list, then delete that address and move the other 2 addresses up and also send them each a $5 dollar bill, and finally to add your name to the bottom of  the list.  The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the bottom of the 3-address list "I get junk E-mail all the time, and  I really didn't think it was gonna work", the boy continues.
<P>Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that  his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills.
<P>"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it.  There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me.  I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack 'cause I couldn't carry it all".
<P>Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.  "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet. With all of this going on, I still had time for my homework".  He had also been riding his bike to several of the area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.  "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.  One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she wouldn't be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."
<P>Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid.  The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all.  In fact, it was completely legal according to <I>US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.</I> Every five dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, "Please add me to your mailing list".  This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (adding the purchaser's name to his mailing list) for a five dollar fee.
<P>Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, simply by following the instructions in this letter-
<P>--------------------------------------------
<P>Here are instructions on how to make $10,000 US cash in the next 2 weeks bruceg:
<P>There are 3 addresses listed below.
<P>Send the person at the top of the list a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note that says: "Please add me to your mailing list".
<P>Then delete that name, move the other 2 up, also sending them each a $5 dollar bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a note that says: "Please add me to your mailing list", and put your name at the bottom.
<P>Now start sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. When 20 people receive it, those 20 people will move your name up to the middle position and they will each send out 20. That totals 400 people that will receive this letter with your name in the middle.
<P>Then, those 400 people will move your name up to the top and they will each send out 20 E-mails.  That totals 8,000 people that will receive this E-mail with your name at the top and they will each send you a $5 bill.
<P>8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill = $40,000 cash.  That's if everyone responds to this E-mail, but not everyone will, so you can expect more realistically to receive about $10,000 cash in $5 bills in your mailbox.
<P>This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but send only a US CASH $5 bill. NO CHECKS or MONEY ORDERS!!!
<P>The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive.  If each person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people that receive this letter when your name reaches the top. If only 1% of those people respond, you will still get $50,000 cash.
<P>Here is the list:
<P>----------------------------------------------------------
<P>1.<FONT FACE = "Times New Roman" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "4">   <B>W. Enrique</B>
<P><B>      P.O. Box 27613</B>
<P><B>      San Antonio, TX 78227</B>
<P><FONT FACE = "Times New Roman" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "3">2.<FONT FACE = "Times New Roman" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "4">   <B>Lourdes Casaca</B>
<P><B>      2501 W 73 PL</B>
<P><B>      Hialeah, FL 33016</B>
<P><FONT FACE = "Times New Roman" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "3">3.<FONT FACE = "Times New Roman" COLOR = "#000000" SIZE = "4">   <B>Wilbur Esquivel</B>
<P><B>      360297 Kelly Dr.</B>
<P><B>      San Antonio, TX 78236</B>    
<P>----------------------------------------------------------
<P>THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. Once your name appears on the list, in a few days, you will start receiving $5 bills from other people just like yourself, who are willing to invest $15 to receive $10,000 cash.
<P>If you don't try it- you will never know. A $15 dollar investment will make you thousands of dollars!!! Give it a try. Trust me bruceg, "You Won't Be Sorry!" YOU ARE <B><U>GUARANTEED</B></U> TO MAKE MONEY!!!
