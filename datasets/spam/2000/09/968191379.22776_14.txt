<HTML><BODY><PRE>TalentProfiles.com found your resume on the web. Since you have
already gone through the effort of creating and posting your resume on
the web, TalentProfiles.com can help you by further promoting your
personal resume page; free of charge and with little or no effort
on your part.

How? TalentProfiles.com is a web based search site used by staffing
specialists to find qualified candidates, kind of a Yahoo like
directory, but just for resumes. Because your resume page has already
been detected, matched and requested by staffing specialists, the only
thing you need to do to participate is to register by confirming the
status of your resume. Hiring managers using our system can then simply
link to your personal web page, review your resume web page for
consideration and contact you directly. We're not a "recruiting
company" and we charge no placement fees.

To confirm the status of your page as well as to view or modify your
resume information go to <a href="http://www.talentprofiles.com/art/servlet/candidate?page=updateResume&resumeId=189719&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.em.ca%2F%7Ebruceg%2Fresume.html">here</a>.

 OR for Hotmail users you will probably need to cut and
paste the entire url below into your browser's address line.

http://www.talentprofiles.com/art/servlet/candidate?page=updateResume&resumeId=189719&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.em.ca%2F%7Ebruceg%2Fresume.html



We will use any modifications or information you want to provide to
ensure that your resume gets you the results you want.

Thanks for your participation!

Sincerely,
Christine McKenna
TalentScout

We apologize if you have received more than one copy of this email.  This probably happened because your resume web page has multiple URL's or has been categorized by our system in more than one job category. You can modify your job category when you update your resume information.</PRE></BODY></HTML>
