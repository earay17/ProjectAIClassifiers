5. POP GOES THE WEASEL
And now, a voice recording tip: When you say words that
begin with consonants like B, C, T or D, you send a blast
of air out and down from your mouth. If your microphone
is in the way of this air blast, you will get 'pop' sounds
in your recording. To avoid this, put your microphone up
and above this blast of air so you won't blast straight
into the microphone and 'pop'.
