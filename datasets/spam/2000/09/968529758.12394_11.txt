Look, we don't want to waste your time, or ours.

If you are determined to retire in the next 2-3 years with enough income to REAL
Financial Independence and Freedom, and are not afraid to work for it, then we can help.

You must have two qualities-moderate people skills and a burning desire to be 
very successful.

If you are skeptical please DO NOT RESPOND! 

If you have a DESIRE FOR CHANGE!
Call me at 1-800-320-9895, ext. 2867 or E-mail me back if you want more 
information at:  igprosperity@excite.com

I will then get back in contact with you for a brief interview.
