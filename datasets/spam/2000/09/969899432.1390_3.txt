Mile High PR Announces Investment Opinion on Carnegie International <BR>
Corporation OTCBB:CGYC<BR>
<BR>
Carnegie International Corporation <A HREF="www.CARNEGIEINT.com">www.CARNEGIEI<BR>
NT.com</A> is now more than ever focused on potential acquisitions, mergers, <BR>
joint ventures and partnerships. In order to create more profit opportunities <BR>
for CGYC, chairman David Gable recently retained Investec Ernst & Company of <BR>
New York City as a financial advisor and investment banker.<BR>
We believe that CGYC could realize an additional $4.5 million in profit in <BR>
the Midwest alone, and could achieve 20% in the market over the next year.  <BR>
With a stock price of over $3.75 a share<BR>
CGYC is looking forward to the increase in revenues of about $15 million due <BR>
to the agreement its subsidiary Paramount International Telecom just signed <BR>
with RoomLinX to offer wireless, high speed internet access in hotel and <BR>
hospital rooms across North America.<BR>
