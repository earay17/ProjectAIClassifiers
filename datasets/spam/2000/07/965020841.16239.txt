After you go to bed, do the walls tremble?
Do small critters in the woodlands scurry for safety?

If that’s true in your household, someone in your home 
might be one of the 90 million Americans who snore. The 
average volume of someone who snores is about as loud as 
normal speech. Really loud snorers can reach the level 
of a loud yell !

Noise like that can be devastating not only the one who 
snores but also the ones that have to hear it.  Bed 
partners of loud snorers can be awakened an average of 
23 times a night. Wow!   

Could you imagine waking up your bed partner by saying, 
honey, are you sleeping? and then repeating that 22 more 
times in one night. Yikes! No wonder non-snoring partners 
can become so irritable!

So, what’s the solution? Expensive surgery? Uncomfortable 
devices? How about 50¢ Ear Plugs?

Sure, if you’re into that sort of stuff. 

Now, there’s a simple solution that works for most people. 
It’s a simple throat spray that you use just before going 
to bed. Just a few squirts before going to bed. It’s 
inexpensive. And the stuff even tastes good!

If you want to learn more about this simple solution, call 
(888) 319-9847. You can call anytime. And if you want to 
tell someone you know, forward this message along. They’ll 
probably be glad you did.   Call now!
