                  123 - Promote!
                 By: Ted Smolkowicz

Web site promotion and the accompanying site traffic it produces 
are not enough to guarantee your online success. Nevertheless, 
you still need them to succeed. It doesn't matter how great your 
site is or how wonderful your product, if nobody visits you won't 
make sales. 
 
As owner of 123-cyber-register.com, webmasters come to me daily 
for advice on how to get more traffic to their site. Here are the 
three common tasks that they (and you) must do before you begin 
your site promotion campaign. 
 
1 - Identify Your Site's Key Phrases 
 
Think like a typical web surfer for just a moment. How do you 
search for information and resources on the web? If you are like 
85% of web surfers, you search in terms of key phrases - not key 
words. 
 
That said, the first task prior to promoting your site is the 
identification of your sites key phrases. What would someone 
type as a search query if they wanted to find the kind of 
information on your site? 
 
Take my web site as an example. The services I offer help people 
professionally promote their web site. How might somebody search 
for my site? They would typically use key phrases such as... 
 
- register web sites - search engine registration - search engine 
submissions - register with search engines 
 
Examine your site and make a list identifying the key phrases a 
potential client would use when searching for the information. 
After all, if they're looking for certain services and products 
and you offer what they're searching for, then you stand a much 
better chance of getting the sale because your prospect is 
pre-qualified. 
 
2 - Name Your Page Appropriately 
 
Now that you've got your list, your next task is to craft your 
page title. This is the place where most webmasters make a 
mistake. They create their title page for the visitor, not the 
search engine. Here's a good rule of thumb: MAKE CERTAIN that 
your page title contains your most important key words and/or 
phrases. 
 
One of the popular promotional services offered at our website is 
the writing and distribution of press releases. We've learned 
that the top phrase most people query when researching this topic 
is 
 
Press Release Service 
 
That's why we made sure that this phrase was a part of the page 
title. The HTML code looks like this: 
 
 
 
3 - Create Your Meta Tags 
 
There are two more places where these phrases need to appear. 
The first place is within the first 250 words of your page. 
Search Engines look there to determine the content of your site. 
The higher your "key phrase density" the better your ranking in 
many search engines. 
 
The next place to use your key phrases is in your meta tags. 
This bit of HTML code helps the search engines and directories 
properly classify and indexed your page. There are two types of 
meta tags - your sites description tag and its key word tag. 
 
The first tag is the description. Use your key phrases to write 
a one sentence (25 words or less) description of your site. 
Here's what my Press Release page looks like: 
 
 
 
Next take your key words and phrases and prepare a key word meta 
tag. Here's what that tag looks like on my press release page: 
 
 
 
Search engines are funny things. Their rules and ranking 
procedures change often. Generally speaking, however, if you 
include your key phrases in the page content, title, and meta tag 
descriptions, you'll have the best chance of gaining and 
maintaining a high ranking. 
 
Good luck!
