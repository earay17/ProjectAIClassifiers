TIRED OF ENDLESSLY POSTING YOUR ONLINE CLASSIFIED AD AND GETTING 
NO RESULTS?

The fact is there are over 7000 such sites scattered about the web
and frankly none of them generate enough traffic to be worth your
while. Even when someone does find or visits one of these sites, your
ad is hopelessly lost in a myriad of similar offerings.

Another frustration is search engines. If you are not in the Top 10
forget about high traffic visiting your web site. Not everyone can be
in the Top 10 and stay there, when there are estimates of 4 million
that have a web pages.

You ask, how do we know? That's exactly what we used to do.
The greatest way of marketing this century is undoubtedly direct
