Subject: Don't Ever Give Up!

Dear Fellow Internet Money Maker, 

I know why you are leaving those dreams of making good money in a home business. I've tried just about every multi-level and product selling scam out there.

Yes, I have waisted my money and my time, not to mention being an embarrassment to my family and friends, when these so-called "Great Home Business" DID NOT WORK.

Well, I'm sure that are some who have done well, but for the most part, I really believe that they did well by getting you in for your little bit of up front money, then promise you riches if follow their plan. Then you keep on putting in that money EVERY month, until you begin to realize, somebody is getting rich, AND IT'S NOT YOU! No wonder you're very skeptical, you SHOULD be. 
Now here's what I got, simple and to the point:

-NO SELLING OF PRODUCTS.
-NO MONTHLY CASH INVESTMENTS.
-YES, WEEKLY CHECKS MAILED TO YOU.
-YES, A HOME BUSINESS YOU WILL BE PROUD OF.
-YES, MY TOTAL SUPPORT.

I have felt your pain. I'm interested in you, and if
you still have any hope for REALLY making money using
the power of the internet, I'd be happy to show you.
PLEASE follow my directions carefully about learning
more. I WILL NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, OR MINE.

 Call Toll-Free  1-888-660-1836

 Leave your name, phone number, and best time to call,
   ONLY if you want to know more.

 I will personally see to it that nobody else gets 
   your information, and I will present this to you as
   quickly and direct as possible.

Sincerely,
          Gregory Alan Payne
