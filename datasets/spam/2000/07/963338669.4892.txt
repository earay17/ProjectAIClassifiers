Hey UBL.com uploader! This is an ALL POINTS BULLETIN on the 
UBL.com / ARTISTdirect nationwide unsigned band competition, 
Born on the Web. It's your chance to win $25,000 in cash, gear 
and promotion to propel your band (or your friend's) to the fame it deserves. 

Born on the Web http://news.artistdirect.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=63EQv03EQt4JVgb01200mYt_zYtx3
is designed to seek out your talent and promote it, using the quality of MP3 
sound files and our internet power. The winner gets that $10,000 cash 
and more - which we hope you'll use to record a killer demo - and prizes, 
gear and a chance to perform at the ARTISTdirect Online Music Awards 
this fall in Las Vegas. 

To enter, just submit a track (or two). There's no entry fee, and registration is 
quick and easy. There are five categories: Hip Hop/Urban, Pop, Rock, Electronic 
and Country. 

Visitors to the site and professional musicians vote on your music to pick the 
winner. Over five weeks of voting, the top 5 bands in each category will be 
showcased, and users will vote for their favorites. Then the pros get to choose 
from the top votegetters; musician judges include Dr. Dre, Clint Black, Aimee Mann, 
Godsmack, and Air. 

We know you're either in a band or know people who are. It's all about you, your 
music and independence. That's why we're inviting you to come in and sign up for 
Born on the Web, Presented By Pringles. 

Pass this on to anyone you know who's in a band that wants a shot at the mother 
load of all contests. Click on the link below to check it out and register. 

Good Luck!
