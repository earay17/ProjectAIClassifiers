NEWS ARTICLE
"Parents of 15-year-old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet."

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have 
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program 
(USA).

{If it doesn't go to www.google.com and Insert the above text into the box, 
between quotation marks.  Surprised??}

His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a
large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and 
a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have 
prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was 
full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds- all neatly 
rubber-banded in labeled piles. "My first thought was that he had robbed a 
bank", says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that 
bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year".

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he
worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came home right away and they 
drove together to the boy's school and picked him up. Little did they 
suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually 
finding it in the closet.

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out an E-mail letter on the
Internet to friends and others, everyday after school for the past 2 months. 
  He had been doing this right on his own computer in his bedroom.

"I just got this E-mail one day and I figured what the heck.  I put my name 
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the 
clever 15-year-old. " I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't 
think it was gonna work", the boy continues.

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazines subscriptions 
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar 
bills. "About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my 
box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a 
yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought 
I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the 
counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
home and empty out my backpack "cause I couldn't carry it all".

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the 
closet, I barely had time for my homework". He had also been riding his bike 
to several of the area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, 
fifties and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack.  
I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in 
[to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady 
gave me a really strange look and told me that she wouldn't be able to do it 
for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the 
next bank down the street (laughs)."

Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid. The reporting
news team examined and investigated the so-called 'chain-letter' the boy was 
sending out and found that it wasn't a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was 
completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 
1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of 
federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product 
or service must be exchanged for money received.

===================================================

Here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by E-mail, so you 
can do the exact same thing he was doing.  Just  follow the simple
instructions in this letter. This came across my Desktop the other day and I 
immediately chose to participate. When you consider the Risk/Reward ratio, 
it's a NO BRAINER. Only a (US) $5.00 and an hour of your time and you could 
make a few thousand dollars faster than you realize.

It's real easy and doesn't take any time at all.  I think that's what it
works so well.
************************************************

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS!

Unlike many other programs, this three level program is more realistic and 
much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate for this program 
is VERY HIGH AND VERY FAST.  You will see results in TWO WEEKS OR LESS! Just 
in time for next month's bills!

Take this entire letter and e-mail out 20 copies to others you know, that 
might want to do this too.  Be sure and send this to people who send you 
their programs too.  After all, they already know these type of programs 
work well.  This particular one is MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has MUCH HIGHER 
RESPONSE RATE because it's not complicated like some of the others. START 
RIGHT NOW! It's VERY SIMPLE and takes a VERY SMALL INVESTMENT. It will pay 
off long before other letters even begin to trickle in!
Here are instructions on how you can be on your way to $10,000 US cash in 
the next 2 weeks:

1. Only 3 addresses are listed below. Send the person at the TOP of the list 
a $5 bill wrapped in 2 pieces of paper (to securely hide it), along with a 
note that says: "Please add me to your mailing list".

2. Then delete that name, move the other 2 up and put your name
at the bottom in the third position.

3. Now start sending this ENTIRE e-mail back out to people. When you get 20 
people to do this also, those 20 people will move your name up to the middle 
position. They will get 20 people to participate also. That totals 400 
people that will receive this letter with yourname in the middle.

Guess What?- Those 400 people will move your name up to the top and they
will each get 20 people by E-mail.  That totals 8,000 people that will
receive this E-mail with your name at the top and they will each send you a 
$5 bill.

8,000 people each sending you a $5 bill = $40,000 cash.  That's if everyone 
follows the plan and actually follow through.  SO, to be realistic, you can 
probably expect to only receive about $10,000 cash in your mailbox. Your 
results will vary  by the individuals who do this with you.

The more E-mails you send out, the more cash you will receive. If
each person sends out 100 E-mails, there will be 1,000,000 people that 
receive this letter when your name reaches the top. If only 1% of
those people respond, you will get $50,000 cash.

Start by sending this to your friends and make a pact that each of you will 
send X number per month for a certain period of time.  That way each of you 
will not only see how quickly this will work but you will also benefit from 
the multiplication of each person's efforts.  Oh- and don't forget to 
promise yourselves something fun to do when the money starts rolling in!  
It's a great way to reach your goal quickly!

This will work for anyone, anywhere in the world in any country, but if
possible, send only a US CASH $5 bill. The more E-mails you send out, the 
more cash you will receive. The way people get email these days, you'll have 
plenty of people to send it to, from the mail you get!

----------------------------------------------------------
Send this person, the $5 ( Yes- it's the HONOUR system)

1.  Julie Stumpf
      PMB # 265
      1385 HWY 35

Move this person in place of # 1 after you're done
2.  Chuck Catto
     3032 Ann Drive
     Bloomington, IL 61704

Move this person to the #2 spot
3.  Andrew Clemitson
     16 Brynderwen Close
     Cardiff, CF23 6BR

NOW add yourself as number 3 . That was easy wasn't it?
----------------------------------------------------------

THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO. When your name reaches the top in a few days, it 
will be your turn to start receiving $5 bills everyday.  Don't stop sending 
it out...because it will continue to work for you ALL the time.  Don't make 
it difficult- do it today and get ready for great fun!

telling me!
