Still skeptical?  Just listen to these testimonials from REAL
people who have used our specially formulated body wraps:

"I was skeptical -- lose INCHES of fat in one hour?!  Well,
let me tell you . . . my first body wrap, I lost 5 inches, and
my second wrap I lost 5-3/4 inches.  But most exciting
was my 3rd wrap when I lost 12-3/4 inches in just ONE
hour!  Forget skepticism -- this is the EASIEST time
I've EVER had losing weight!"
-- Holly Cotter, MD

"I do a lot of body wraps on a lot of people.  I see a lot
of different results.  One thing is for sure -- they ALL
lose inches, and the inches stay off!  On average, with
the body wraps I do, they lose between 7 and 11
inches with the first wrap, another 5 to11 inches with
the second, 3 to 9 inches with the third, and another
3 to 9 inches with the fourth wrap.  The inches ALWAYS
stay off, and they never go back to the size they were
in the beginning.  I'm also finding that it helps people
with aches and pains.  It is very soothing, especially
for people with arthritis and fibromyalgia."
--Tracey Long, PA

"About 3 months ago I was taking a surfing trip to
Mexico and I wanted to lose some weight. I did the
diet thing and the gym thing, but I still had a little bit
of a stomach. So I decided to try the Body Wrap.
When I first heard about the Body Wrap I thought it
was a complete joke, but I was just about ready to
try anything because I wanted to feel great in a
bikini. So, one night, my girlfriends and I decided
to take turns on doing the Body Wrap. I did a spot
wrap just on my stomach. On the first wrap I lost 3
inches. I was excited because I went to Mexico with
a flat stomach. My other friends lost at least 8 inches
with a full body wrap. We tell everyone who wants to
lose inches in a matter of hours to do one!"
--Kristine Snodgrass, CA

"I just did my first body wrap a few days ago and it was
fantastic! I lost 5 inches in just 1 hour! After completing the
wrap, I had the best night's sleep I had had in a long time
and I woke up very refreshed & energized. My body feels
tighter & "lighter" now too. I can't wait to see the results
after 3 more wraps over the next 3 weeks!"
--Suzy Cole, OR

"My very first wrap I lost a total of 5 1/2 inches from my waist
down. My legs felt smoother and more toned. I did another
wrap about 10 days later and I lost an additional 4 inches.
The inches have stayed off. My husband has even noticed the
results. Now I am ready for my summer vacation to the beach.
I totally recommend the Herbal Body Wrap to anyone
who wants to lose inches and feel great."
--Stacy Russell, TX
