A Special Invitation For You,

We are sending you this email message to help build our "in house"
opt-in mailing list. By joining our list, you will receive our monthly
computer "Software Specials" that could save you hundreds or even
thousands of dollars on future software purchases versus normal retail
pricing! We carry hundreds of popular software titles from Adobe, Corel,
Microsoft, Symantec, and others!

Why are our prices so affordable?
We have sources who cut out the expensive "Middle Man"...which means BIG
SAVINGS FOR YOU!  The superstores and mail order catalogs are
typically 20%-30% or more for the same software titles!

If you are interested in purchasing our monthly specials, or if you
are in need of a price quote or you just want to be part of our VIP
Mailing List, we ask that you send us an email requesting so.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attention: Starting February 21, 2000, by being a part of our "VIP" opt-in mailing
list,you will automatically be entered into our monthly "Take The CASH And Run" drawing
for $100, $200, and $300.  Winners will be announced on March 21, 2000, on our website
and via email on next months mailing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remember, if you have a computer, from time to time you will need to
purchase computer software.  Wouldn't it be nice to save a bundle instead
of spending one?

February Specials!
Adobe PhotoShop 5.5
Adobe Illustrator 8.0
MS Office 2000 Professional
MS Project 98
