Please allow me to introduce "World Wide Developers"
 http://www.worldwidedevelopers.com" as a completely new co-operative of
Internet developers from around the world.

Our global shortage or resources for creating these fantastic web sites has
forced organizations to be flexible in their resource recruitment.
Telecommuting your skills has become their latest alternative to fulfilling
those shortcomings and for you an opportunity to make a generous full or
part time income. Our goal is to organize skills related to the inter/intra
net, including technical, application development and artistic, into a
co-operative where companies globally can search for resources.

At our site feel free to browse through our client postings and contact us
if you feel you are qualified for any assignment. When a match is made we
will facilitate an interview between you and the client.

We are a developer/client introduction service and are not interested in a
percentage of the contract. We only ask a small amount from the client for
the introduction and you pay absolutely no fees. A large portion of the
proceeds go to maintaining this site and advertising around the world.

Please fell free to contact World Wide Developers through our web site if
you would like our help or have any questions about this service.


Sincerely,

Rick Morcom
President, World Wide Developers
