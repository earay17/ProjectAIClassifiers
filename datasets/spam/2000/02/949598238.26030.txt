Subject: HOW TO FIND A WALL STREET "PEARL"
Mime-Version: 1.0

TO FIND A WALL STREET "PEARL" (a hidden stock of great value), 
you can "open a lot of oysters" ... or you can read Wall Street 
Whispers.  Reading Wall Street Whispers is easier.
 
If you had read the August 6 issue of Wall Street Whispers, you 
would have read about AREMISSOFT CORP (AREM), recommended at 7. 
AREM went up to 34 3/4 and closed 01/03/2000 at 30 5/8. 
 
If you had read the August 11 issue of Wall Street Whispers, you 
would have read about FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CORP (FPCX), 
recommended at 0.56. It went up to 15 3/4 and closed 01/03/2000 
at 12 3/4.   It's not Microsoft at 0.25, but it's not bad... and 
we believe it's going to get better yet.
 
These are just a couple of the pearls that Wall Street Whispers 
could have helped you find in 1999.  Want us to help you find 
some others in 2000??? You can go to www.wallstwhispers.com and 
subscribe yourself, or you can email us at whispers@dcnet2000.com 
or call us at 713-222-8880 (Houston, TX) -- no electronic 
receptionist with "menus from hell", just a real live person to 
talk to you. 
 
Whether you subscribe or not (and we really wish you would 
subscribe), to thank you for reading our message, you can find a 
free "pearl" by emailing us at whispers@dcnet2000.com and type 
the word "pearl".  We will email it back to you. To be deleted 
from our list, just ask us to remove you. Best regards,
 
Wall Street Whispers Staff
