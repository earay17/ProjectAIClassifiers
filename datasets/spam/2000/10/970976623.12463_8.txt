A Well Hidden Undervalued Company

MassAwareness Presents Docuport Inc.  DCPT (OB)

Press Release: October 2, 10:36 a.m. eastern time

Docuport Inc. is introducing two revolutionary products for business travelers’ “briefcase offices” - a printer/scanner/copier/fax the size of a three-hole punch and a 4-ounce, full-page scanner with a 100-page memory.

The former, named the Chameleon , weighs just two pounds and was recognized as one of the top six products introduced at the ’99 COMDEX show in Las Vegas.

The Docupen, an 8-½ inch by ½ inch scan pen, will be on the market by December 2000 at a price of less than $100. 

Both will be in the consumer marketplace in time for holiday purchases and are perfect accessories to the PDAs business people already own or will be receiving as gifts.

KEYFACT™ Docuport has announced it has $105,000,000 million in long-term purchase commitments worldwide from RCA (in the US), Peripheral Corner (in the UK) and Pan International (Asia/pacific).

KEYFACT™ RCA alone will market these revolutionary products through Best Buy, Radio Shack, The Wiz, CompuServe and many other retail outlets.

MassAwareness has rated Docuport OTC BB (DCPT.OB) a STRONG BUY and believes that Docuport is positioned to become the premiere provider and manufacturer  of portable imaging information appliances; That's why we feel the stock is UNDERVALUED! It's worth looking into.

It is our opinion that Docuport has re-innovated the computer peripheral industry.  We believe that the company has strong management supporting its team of visionaries as well as great potential.
