PREDICTED MARKET DECLINE IN THIS NOTE TO OUR CONSULTING CLIENTS ($3500/yr) ON 
OCT 6

CRAWFORD PERSPECTIVES

October 6, 2000

CONSULTING CLIENTS

THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD!

RALLY ATTEMPTS FAILED, SET UP FOR MUCH LARGER DOWN!

Although some of our momentum studies became EXTREMELY Oversold,  the
technical patterns have continued to reveal weaker and weaker market
action. We thought that there was a possibility for a greater rally, 
still within the Long Term Topping Pattern, which could THEN deteriorate
right after Election Day! 
Other normal technical studies improved enough to give that sort of
bounce, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO STOP A MAJOR DECLINE AFTER MAJOR SUPPORT HAS
BEEN VIOLATED!

The BULLS have NOT prevailed and MAJOR SUPPORTS are BREAKING DOWN
MENACINGLY!

We said in the October letter: "Although there is room for further
downside  among a number of other market indicators... there is Maximum
downside expansion in Number of Down Hours and Down Hours and Down Days
by our proprietary time measures.  Further declines would result in far
greater Technical Damage to Major Support Areas, Long-term Rising
Trendlines , and 200-Day Moving Averages."

The rally attempts Worked Off the best of our Oversold TIME Factors
leaving markets Very VULNERABLE!

The NASDAQ was the first to break down and has Never been able to
develop ANY strength on rallies.

The DJIA has still NOT broken, but is in the verge of doing so NOW.

All three Major Indices have been unable to recover above 200-Day Moving
Averages.

WE MUST CONSIDER CURRENT SUPPORT BREAKS AS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS!

SELL AND SHORT (NOW) INTO THE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED LOW OCTOBER 18-(27).

HOW DID ARCH CRAWFORD DEVELOP HIS THEORY AND
HOW DOES HE APPLY IT TO THE STOCK MARKET?

"Over the past five years, the timing advice of only one market-timing
newsletter ... has outpaced the simple strategy of buying and holding
... the S&P 500 ... Crawford Perspectives."  Kiplinger's Personal
Finance, 7/97Arch Crawford, publisher of Crawford Perspectives, has been
referred to in Barron's as "Wall Street's best known astrologer."  For
32 years he has compiled market data and astrological evidence to prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt that planetary movements have a profound
impact on people and the stock and commodities markets.  Crawford began
his career at Merrill Lynch as a technical market analyst and in May of
1977 published the first edition of Crawford Perspectives.  Although
Crawford Perspectives has changed its look over the years, Crawford's
accuracy has remained amazingly consistent.  From May 1977 to early 1981
he was correct on Buy and Sell points 9 times out of 10.

	Astronomic cycles and harmonic events have a profound impact on the
stock and commodity markets.  In the mid 1970's, an RCA Corporation
researcher, John Nelson, helped Crawford in proving that planetary
alignment relative to the Sun could help time the market.  John would
call Crawford at the exact moment that a flare was in progress and in
turn Crawford would call a broker and find that, typically, the stock
market was declining sharply and that respectively Gold was rising
during this geomagnetically disturbed period of time!  In fact, the
highest sustained period of ionospheric electrons measured by
geosyncronous satellite took place during the week before and during the
1987 market crash, and dropped back on the day of the stock market low! 
There is strong scientific evidence that gravitational and
electromagnetic forces have a direct causal relationship to many growth
patterns and cycles on Earth.

	Arch Crawford maintains 28 technical market indicators, many of which
he developed.  He says "My astronomic work, as powerful as it is, is
still developing, and it is necessary to keep two fingers on the pulse
of the market through technical analysis."  Subscribe to Crawford
Perspectives today and witness his amazing accuracy in quintessential
market timing by planetary cycles and technical analysis.

Personal Finance, 7/97.
