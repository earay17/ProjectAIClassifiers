	As a business and corporate law attorney, I've spent years advising companies of all sizes about how to be successful.  One burning issue stands out among all of them, whether they're a one-person operation or an international firm:

	AS A RULE, THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE LOSING DUE TO GIVING AWAY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.  AND THEY ALL DO IT, WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT!

	Your company's trade secrets are its most vital assets.  Customer lists, marketing plans, financial information and vendor relationships and terms are just a few of the items that, in the hands of a competitor, WILL have a very significant negative impact on your business.  Can you imagine what your business could do with that information about your competitors?
	
	I've written THE BUSINESS GUIDE TO TRADE SECRETS specifically for businesspeople, not other attorneys.  This practical book is intended to be actively used by your company in managing this most crucial aspect of a company's assets and future success.  The book is written in an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand format and included the following topics:

 C 	What is a trade secret?
C 	What kind of information is protectible?
C 	How do I keep former employees from taking or disclosing my trade secrets during their employment and after they leave, especially to work for a competitor?
C 	What kind of policies and procedures are right for my business in protecting my trade secrets?
C 	and more.
	
	As a SPECIAL BONUS and for a limited time, THE BUSINESS GUIDE TO TRADE SECRETS also includes several helpful forms for use by businesses of any size, including:
 C 	 non-disclosure agreements; 
C 	employee confidentiality agreements;
C 	letters to former employees and new employers regarding their obligations to maintain the confidentiality of your trade secret information; 
C 	and more.
	
	We absolutely guarantee that you will find THE BUSINESS GUIDE TO TRADE SECRETS an invaluable resource and business tool.  As a practicing attorney, I know the information is useful and timely and will help you to ensure your company's success.

	For a limited time, THE BUSINESS GUIDE TO TRADE SECRETS is available for $79.95 plus $4.25 shipping and handling.  Forms on disk is available for an additional $5.  Payment may be made at PAYPAL.COM or by check payable to CANNON BUSINESS LAW GROUP, P.C.  For ordering information, please contact us at  wecanhelp45@hkem.com.  Please allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.
