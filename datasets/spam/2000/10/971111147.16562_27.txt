Bonus Stock Pick: MassAwareness Presents Docuport Inc. DCPT (OB)

Press Release: October 2, 10:36 a.m. eastern time

Docuport Inc. is introducing two revolutionary products for business 
travelers' "briefcase offices" - a printer/scanner/copier/fax the size of a 
three-hole punch and a 4-ounce, full-page scanner with a 100-page memory.

The former, named the Chameleon , weighs just two pounds and was recognized 
as one of the top six products introduced at the '99 COMDEX show in Las Vegas.


The Docupen, an 8-½ inch by ½ inch scan pen, will be on the market by 
December 2000 at a price of less than $100.

Both will be in the consumer marketplace in time for holiday purchases and 
are perfect accessories to the PDAs business people already own or will be 
receiving as gifts.

KEYFACT™ Docuport has announced it has $105,000,000 million in long-term 
purchase commitments worldwide from RCA (in the US), Peripheral Corner (in 
the UK) and Pan International (Asia/pacific).

KEYFACT™ RCA alone will market these revolutionary products through Best 
Buy, Radio Shack, The Wiz, CompuServe and many other retail outlets.

MassAwareness has rated Docuport OTC BB (DCPT.OB) a STRONG BUY and believes 
that Docuport is positioned to become the premiere provider and 
manufacturer of portable imaging information appliances; That's why we feel 
the stock is UNDERVALUED! It's worth looking into.
It is our opinion that Docuport has re-innovated the computer peripheral 
industry. We believe that the company has strong management supporting its 
team of visionaries as well as great potential.
Don't be an investor who wishes you had known about a great company from 
the start...but don't take our word for it; be a wise investor, and 
thoroughly research this and every other company before purchasing any 
stock. For a FREE subscription to the MassAwareness E-newsletter email us
