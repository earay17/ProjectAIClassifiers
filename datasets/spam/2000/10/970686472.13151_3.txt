The purpose of this email is to inform you of a little-followed stock that
may fit your investing model.  I-Sector Corporation (Nasdaq:  ISEC) is a
company that is going through a transformation.  Formerly known as Allstar
Systems, Inc., the company changed its name recently after selling its two
business units that were involved in the resell of computer and telephone
systems.  Three of the company's current business units, which are each
organized as focused wholly owned subsidiaries, produce revenues from
information technology services, while another subsidiary produces and
markets its own proprietary software used in computerized call centers.  A
recently announced new subsidiary, Internetworking Sciences Corporation,
intends to pursue opportunities in the design, deployment and support of
network infrastructure.  The company has recently announced its intention to
commit capital resources to wholly owned subsidiaries "that are expected to
benefit from the manner in which the Internet is changing the world."
I-Sector's stock has recently traded for less than half of annual sales
(from continuing operations) and less than tangible book value.  The
company's balance sheet contains no goodwill and no debt.  The company has
repurchased over 7.5% of the total outstanding shares during 1998 and 1999.
Management owns approximately half of the approximately 4.4 million
outstanding shares. For additional information about I-Sector you can
email us with your address at mailto:stock_option@n2mail.com and we will see that an investor information package is sent out to you promptly.

Good luck with your investing!
