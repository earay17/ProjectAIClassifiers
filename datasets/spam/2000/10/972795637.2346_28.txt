Getting Started
To become an Associate of Wealth Vision International requires the
completion and acceptance of a new Associate Application and Agreement.
As a new Associate you may purchase any of the product packs offered by
Wealth Vision.  Every product pack you purchase generates "personal
volume" or PV.

The 2 x 3 Matrix
For example, when you generate $167 in PV (by purchasing the
Introduction Pack) you become qualified to enter the $167 PV matrix and
are placed on the next available position on your sponsor's matrix.
Once your position is established on your sponsor's matrix, you start
out with a brand new 2 x 3 matrix of your own.  In essence, your 2 x 3
matrix resides somewhere within your sponsor's 2 x 3 matrix.  Your new 2

x 3 matrix is comprised of fourteen (14) open positions with three (3)
levels (see diagram below).



Matrix Commissions

With the support of your sponsor, you work towards filling your 2 x 3
matrix with new Associates who have generated $167 in PV.  Then you, in
turn, assist each of these to develop new Associates of their own, until

every spot in your matrix is filled.

If you are qualified** and any four (4) spots on your 3rd level fill,
you earn a commission.  When the remaining four (4) spots fill on your
3rd level fill, you earn another commission and e-voucher.  Commissions
are determined by matrix level (discussed in more detail later) and are
shown in the table below.



* E- vouchers are discussed in detail below.

** To become qualified to receive commissions you must personally
sponsor two (2) new Associates who have each generated the appropriate
PV, for example, $167.  Newly sponsored Associates DO NOT have to be on
your current 2 x 3 matrix, however they must reside somewhere within the

same matrix level.  Once you have qualified within a matrix level, you
are no longer subject to additional sponsoring qualifications.  You are,

of course, encouraged to assist your downline Associates.

Matrix Re-Entry

Once you have completed a given matrix you are automatically re-entered
within that same matrix level, taking the next highest position under
your sponsor.  Remember, you can continue to refer new Associates to
Wealth Vision as well as help your downline Associates develop their
organizations.  Once your downline Associates fill their matrix, they
will reenter and follow you onto the next highest matrix position below
you.

World Vision E-Vouchers

When you fill a matrix, Wealth Vision offers you matrix commissions, an
automatic reentry within the same level and a bonus e-voucher.
E-vouchers can be used to purchase over 5,000 name-brand products within

an online mall.  The mall features a diverse selection of products from
golf-balls to RolexT watches.  You simply select the products you wish
to buy and use the e-vouchers to pay for your purchase online.
E-vouchers will also accumulate within your Wealth Vision account as
they are received and are valid for six (6) months from the date of
issue.

The following table shows the dollar amount of e-voucher you receive per

completed matrix level:



Matrix Commission Levels

Wealth Vision offers a total of four (4) commission matrix levels.
These are the $167, $500, $1,500 and $5,000 PV levels.  An Associate may

advance to a specific level by either purchasing the equivalent product
pack (PV value) or by choosing to automatically upgrade when they enroll

as a new Associate.  Please refer to the Terms and Conditions for
details as well as the Automatic Upgrade Program below.

Note: There is no requirement for an Associate to advance to higher
matrices if they do not wish to do so.

Matrix Dynamics

Automatic Upgrade Program

The first time you complete a matrix level you have the option to
automatically upgrade to the next higher matrix level, for example you
could advance from the $167 level to the $500 level.  By automatically
using your commissions from the matrix you have just completed, the
Automatic Upgrade Program will purchase the next level's product pack on

your behalf.  You will advance seamlessly from your current matrix level

to the next one, until you reach the $5,000 PV matrix.  You will then
cycle on all four (4) levels simultaneously.

Line of Sponsorship Integrity

Whenever you reenter a level you will always follow your sponsor on to
the next highest position available on their matrix, as you did when you

first qualified to enter that level.  If you progress to a new higher
level and your sponsor does not yet have a position on that level, you
will take the next position available under your immediate upline.  Once

your original sponsor does join that matrix level, you will once again
follow them directly.

The Magic of the Spill Factor

Another unique factor of Wealth Vision is the "spill factor".  Here's
how it works:

Once your upline has filled their two (2) downline positions, every new
Associate must join the matrix in the next available open position from
left to right.  By entering at the highest level possible in your
sponsor's matrix, you now become eligible to receive "spill" in the form

of new Associates placed under you.  Unlike most compensation plans, in
Wealth Vision you are eligible to get paid on all spill.



The above diagram is intended for illustration purposes only, as a
sample configuration.  Wealth Vision makes no claims or
representations.  Commissions earned will vary from Associate to
Associate.

Commissions are calculated daily and paid weekly.
