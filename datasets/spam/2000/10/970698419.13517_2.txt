The Best Home-Based Business Surplus/Wholesale merchandise affiliate
 Import/Export & Domestic
"The best and most unique Training and support world"

The Association provides its Affiliates with complete hands-on training and 
ongoing support for domestic, import and export transactions. It also provides 
its Affiliates with exclusive listings of new, first quality wholesale and surplus
merchandise, at the best possible prices. Additionally, the Association guarantees
delivery, payment and customer satisfaction of this merchandise in a timely and
professional manner.

Your Objective
The objective is simple; put a buyer and a seller together and collect a fee.
The Association's Affiliates deal with all sizes of companies, from "Mom and Pop" 
stores to Fortune 500 Corporations, involving all types of merchandise and 
consumer goods.

<> The Merchandise
<> Anything & Everything
<> Electronics
<> Clothing
<> Industrial Products
<> Household Items
<> Sporting Goods

   The merchandise listed on the Association's Exclusive Exchange is brand new, 
first quality and includes the manufacturer's warrantees and guarantees. 

The association does NOT deal in distressed, seconds or used merchandise.

A good example of this is a new 1999 model television set, offered for sale, 
after the 2000 models are available.
 
 <>  A High Demand Business
The industry itself is truly recession proof and is constantly expanding as we move
towards a worldwide economy. Everyone always wants a bargain. The business is a legitimate,
fast paced, multifaceted, action business which can provide its participants with excitement
and the freedom of time, afforded by money.

<>  Is It For Me?
The association's founders prefer that its new Affiliates have no experience in this 
type of business. "

We would rather take a rookie who has common sense, good work habits, a strong 
desire to learn and a positive attitude than a person who is already in the business and is
set in their ways of doing things and might have difficulty in adapting to our techniques,
procedures and general way of doing business."

<>   Our Affiliates come from all walks of life. Some start the business part time and then
     go full time, others start full time and then go part time, when their success allows
     them the pursuit of other interests and priorities.

<>  Sales With No Salesmanship Required
    The clients are already familiar with the brand name merchandise, and therefore no
    salesmanship is required. In the event the buyer is not familiar with the merchandise being
    offered, the affiliate simply supplies them with a sample.

<>  The Market Is Immense
    There are over 120 categories of US Retail Outlets and Dealers in our client database.

<>   Success
    If the training is followed, virtually anyone can succeed in this exciting business.
    Men and women of all ages, working part time or full time, can be earning fees almost
    immediately. The benefits of our comprehensive training, exclusive and successful
    business techniques, and on-going support prepare our affiliates to make action
    decisions, interact with people from around the world, and take charge of their own future!

<>  The Opportunities Are Limitless!
       Investment - $6,950
