THE CONTRARIAN BUY ALERT:

Tidalwave Holdings Inc.
Symbol (TDWV-OTCBB)
Recent Price: $.20
52 Week Range: $.05 - $.40
Estimated Float: 7.7 Million
Shares Outstanding: 31.2 Million Shares

When a public company changes its name and symbol, it often signals a new
direction for their stock.

Tidalwave Holdings Inc. changed its name last month, and also lined up millions in
financing for acquisitions. TDWV peaked above $1 back in April 1999, but then got
bogged down with the new SEC reporting requirements in July of last year. The
Company spent many months trading on the pink sheets, leading to an all-time low
of 5 cents on 12/29/99.

Now Tidalwave is back on the OTC Bulletin Board with a whole new attitude. They
recently acquired MobileHomeTrader.com for 3 million dollars, and hope to qualify for a
NASDAQ listing once the stock price improves. As their name suggests, MobileHome
specializes in finding people who need mortgages for all types of "manufactured housing",
including the difficult to finance subprime and singlewide units.

They also just announced the availability of a new $5 million warehouse credit line to fund
loans originated by customers who use the MobileHomeTrader.com web site.

In addition to the mortgage business, TDWV also operates a computer division offering
various Internet and software products. Please visit their website at:
http://www.tidalwaveholdings.com for more information.

The Contrarian suggests making purchases up to the $.50 area, with a long-term target of
$1 plus.
