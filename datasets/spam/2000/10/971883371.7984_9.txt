<BR>
The key partnership with Tyco coincides with SURG's upcoming launch of the=
ir Oasis Information Exchange (www.OasisOR.com), whereby the Oasis Network=
 will be linked with each Tyco companies' web site. Tyco's usage of Oasis =

ot available anywhere else. OasisOR.com offers unlimited potential in the =
$500 BILLION healthcare industry for providing a multimedia healthcare dat=
a center linking healthcare workers, administrators, patients, and medical=
 / pharmaceutical suppliers.   <BR>
