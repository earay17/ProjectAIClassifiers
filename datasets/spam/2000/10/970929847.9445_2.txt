Dear Online Marketer,

We have found that you are doing business on the internet and 
hope everything is going well for you.

I thought I'd drop this one-time quick note to let you know about an 
EXCELLENT e-Commerce business which has enjoyed rapid and 
consistent growth in the last 4 years. It may fit very well into your 
business portfolio.

This is easily the  BEST online business today; it is virtually 
a SELF-RUN ONLINE BUSINESS. It has TWICE been voted as the #1 online 
business.

"I'm having 10 times the success with this business as 
I did with my other MLMs that I tried. I have a personal closure 
rate of about 80%. And I attribute that totally to the system that 
you have created. It truly is the best company out there. Since 
joining in August of this year, I have been approached by 3 
distributors of other companies, including 1 co-founder, but 
after explaining what I do in my business and how I work the 
opportunity, I guess they've given up knowing that their program 
is much harder to achieve success in."

If your current program demands that you sell products and 
sponsor others you will fail 90% of the time! Put yourself in the 
power position; win 90% of the time offering a program that 
everyone wants to be involved with!
