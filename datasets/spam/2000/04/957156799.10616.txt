Ever wanted to lose weight while sitting on your butt in front of the TV???


Well now you can!!     How you say?


With three powerful body organs working together to decrease metabolism, how will you ever lose those extra pounds? - Increase Metabolic Fat Burning! 



http://www.jumbomart.com/products/product.php/116/

Metabolic Thyrolean works on all three regulatory areas involved in metabolism. In the thyroid, Metabolic Thyrolean improves the conversion of thyroid hormones, which means that the more active hormones work for you instead of against you. It also fools the liver into thinking that you are storing plenty of ATP, which means that the liver has no reason to regulate your metabolism downward. Finally, in the brain, Metabolic Thyrolean provides the substrates to build neurotransmitters-without the need for calories. The final result is that metabolism remains elevated, with a positive effect on metabolism, calorie-burning and fat loss. This cutting edge formula takes a whole new approach to weight loss. 






1time mail of e-Fatnews. No more fat loss info will come unless you request it.
