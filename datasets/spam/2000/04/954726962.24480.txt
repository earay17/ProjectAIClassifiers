   "I build and operate competitive drag racing engines. These engines
   normally last six races. We treated an engine with your products, and
   it ran for two complete years (over 50 races!) without tear-down or
   engine failure. When we finally took this motor apart, the engine
   bearings still had part of the original protective coating.  The cam and
   lifters showed virtually no wear.

   For years, I have searched for a superior lubrication that could withstand
   the extreme demands of a racing engine.  That search ended with your
   incredible technology.  I use it in both my racing and personal cars. You
   can't argue with success. The products work!"

   -- Andy Callahan Engine builder, race car driver &  World Record Holder

   Test performed at BIMCO, INC. - Bingham Machine Co

   "I bid a job drilling 74,880 .052 diameter holes in aluminum plate. When
   we started this job we had broke off 4 drill bits in the plate in less than 400
   holes drilled.  We thought for sure that we were going to lose a lot of
   money.  At this time, we tried using your products in a spray mist on the
   drill bit as it was drilling.  We successfully drilled over 74,000 holes
   without breaking any more bits and ended up finishing the job ahead of
   schedule. When we figured out our cost, we made about 10% over rate."

   "I drive a 1993 Lincoln Town car with a big V-8 engine.  I have your
   products in it and get between 26-30 miles per gallon on the highway
   and 23-24 miles per gallon back and forth to work.  I have four snow
   mobiles, three motorcycles, four cars, two trucks and 15 machines
   at my place of business that use your products."

   "I recently purchased a 1994 boat with a 454 V-8 engine, I have already
   started to use your products in it as well."

   "Your products don't cost us money, they save us BIG money!"

   Lewis Bingham President BIMCO, INC. - Bingham Machine Co

   "A customer of ours has an old Toyota pickup that leaked oil.  When the
   oil level got low, the engine would begin to make a loud tapping noise. This
   was due to the lack of oil supply to the valves.  After treating his truck with
   your product, he had traveled quite some time without checking the oil
   level.  He had not heard the usual noise telling him the oil level was low.
   When he finally did check the engine's oil level, it was three quarts low!
   In addition, he had also noticed an increase in horsepower.  Needless
   to say, your products quickly made a believer out of him."

   -- Glenn Mitchell - Business Owner SAV-MOR AUTO CLINIC

 ==========================================================

   "I have a 1986 Honda Accord with 100,000 plus miles on the odometer.
   This car formerly averaged between 37 and 39 miles per gallon. When
   testing your product, the cruise control was set at 65mph.  My car increased
   to 45.7 miles per gallon.   I have documentation which I'll send with my
   next order!"

   -- Norm Hoefs Business Owner - Norm's Foreign Cars North Dakota

 ==========================================================

   Look, you have a lot of money invested in your car or truck.
   You depend on your vehicle to perform everyday without any problems.
   Doesn't it make sense to at least take a look at some technology that
   could up to triple the return of your investment? (Up to triple the life of your
   car or truck!)

   It's no news to you that your local auto parts retailer has literally hundreds of
   car-care products from which you can choose.  You've also seen the
   commercials on late night TV and you've read the articles about these
   so-called "snake-oil" sales people.  Can you believe everything you see,
   or is it just a lot of smoke and mirrors, advertising hype and paid professional
   acting?

   There are companies playing on people's ignorance of engine mechanical
   principles of how they work.  These guys sell their junk to you by making
   outrageous claims of what their products will do for your vehicle.

   How Will My Vehicle Benefit From Your Products?

   It's been proven that 70-80% of the total wear in a car's engine occurs
   during the start-up. The oil pump can take as long as 3 minutes to
   completely circulate the engines vital fluids throughout the system.
   When you turn the car off, the oil drains to the bottom of the engine.
   This leaves very little protection from metal to metal wear when you start
   the engine again.

   Regular and synthetic motor oils will not stop this damaging wear from
   ruining your car's engine.  Our technology protects any engine by
   creating an impenetrable barrier on the internal metal parts of the engine.
   With this technology, THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO WEAR!!!

   You benefit by getting extra power, better gas mileage and reduced emissions.
   You benefit by saving literally hundreds of dollars every year.

   Product Features:

      +  Petroleum-based kinetic energy formula.
      +  No Teflon or PTFE.
      +  Completely cleans and optimizes the fuel system.
      +  Rejuvenates - seals and gaskets.
      +  Catalytic Converter Safe.
      +  Maintain a "like new" engine in your Car, Truck,
          RV, ATV, Boat, Snowmobile, Jet Ski, Lawn Mower,
          Motorcycle...
      +  Less worry when you're alone on the road and away
          from home.
      +  Reduce the risk of costly breakdowns.
      +  Substantially lower operating cost.
      +  Increase gas mileage and horsepower.
      +  Environmentally Friendly Products.
      +  100% Satisfaction Guaranteed.
      +  Independent laboratory test verification.

   What Do People Say About Their Experience
   Using This New Technology?

   "In July, 1995, I purchased a 1995 Chevrolet Lumina Sedan.  I had been
   assured that I would get 24-25 mile per gallon around town, and 29-30 mpg
   on the highway."

   "I added this incredible product to the engine, transmission, cooling system
   and power steering.  I added the inventors racing concentrate to the fuel - 2
   oz. per ten gallons of fuel."

   "Near the end of August, we took a trip to Oregon. We averaged 50-55 miles
   per hour.  During the return trip we drove a distance of 505 miles. Most of
   the trip back home we drove 65-75 m.p.h., with the air conditioning on at
   least 80% of the time.  When I refueled in Provo, I found that we had gotten
   35.1 mpg."

   "Our average mile per gallon for the entire trip (including some city driving
   in Portland) was 30.25 miles per gallon using 85 octane fuel and the
   inventors racing formula."

   "We are sold on this technology. The products are money-savers."

   -- Robert V. Larsen Orem, UT

 ==========================================================

   "I have a 1994 Dodge Ram. It has averaged 14.8 miles per gallon for the
   last two years. After adding your product, my truck now averages 16.75
   miles per gallon.  This means an extra 3 gallons of fuel savings every week.
   Needless to say, I am very impressed, and will be recommending the products
   to everyone I meet.  Thanks for a great product!"

   -- Ken Strain West Hills, California
