Introducing Snoreless!

Instead, it targets the annoying noise associated with snoring and provides up to eight hours of quiet relief. 

Snoring affects millions of people worldwide. It's a hoarse, harsh noise made by breathing through the mouth while sleeping. Snoring is caused by a partial blockage of the air passage by soft tissues in the throat pressing against each other, causing a vibration and the resulting noise.

Snoreless is proven to be helpful in reducing the noise associated with snoring, and in some cases, helps to eliminate the problem all together. By spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with a special formula, manufactured by a patented process known as Liposome, the soft tissues are coated, allowing up to eight hours of restful, silent sleep. Snoreless coats the throat area with a unique blend of natural lubricants, including almond oil, olive oil, peppermint oil and sunflower oil. Also added are vitamins B6, C and E. Vitamin B6,  and Vitamin C.
