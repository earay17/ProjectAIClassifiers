123 - Promote!
---------


Web site promotion and the accompanying site traffic it produces are not 
enough to guarantee your online success. Nevertheless, you still need
them to succeed. It doesn't matter how great your site is or how
wonderful your product, if nobody visits you won't make sales.

As owner of 123-cyber-register.com, webmasters come to me daily for
advice on how to get more traffic to their site. Here are the three
common tasks that they (and you) must do before you begin your site 
promotion campaign.

1 - Identify Your Site's Key Phrases

Think like a typical web surfer for just a moment.  How do you search for
information and resources on the web? If you are like 85% of web
surfers, you search in terms of key phrases - not key words.

That said, the first task prior to promoting your site is the 
identification of your sites key phrases.  What would someone type as a 
search query if they wanted to find the kind of information on your site?

Take my web site as an example. The services I offer help people 
professionally promote their web site. How might somebody search for my 
site?  They would typically use key phrases such as...

- register web sites 
- search engine registration 
- search engine submissions 
- register with search engines

Examine your site and make a list identifying the key phrases a potential
client would use when searching for the information. After all, if
they're looking for certain services and products and you offer what 
they're searching for, then you stand a much better chance of getting
the sale because your prospect is pre-qualified.

2 - Name Your Page Appropriately

Now that you've got your list, your next task is to craft your page title.
This is the place where most webmasters make a mistake. They create
their title page for the visitor, not the search engine.  Here's a good
rule of thumb: MAKE CERTAIN that your page title contains your most 
important key words and/or phrases.

One of the popular promotional services offered at our website is the 
writing and distribution of press releases.  We've learned that the top 
phrase most people query when researching this topic is
Press Release Service

That's why we made sure that this phrase was a part of
the page title.  The HTML code looks like this:

<title>1 2 3 Cyber Register Press Release Service</title>

3 - Create Your Meta Tags

There are two more places where these phrases need to appear.  The first 
place is within the first 250 words of your page.  Search Engines look 
there to determine the content of your site.  The higher your "key phrase
density" the better your ranking in many search engines.

The next place to use your key phrases is in your meta tags. This bit 
of HTML code helps the help search engines and directories properly 
classified and indexed your page.  There are two types of meta tags -
your sites description tag and its key word tag.

The first tag is the description.  Use your key phrases to write a one 
sentence (25 words or less) description of your site.  Here's what my
Press Release page looks like:

<meta name="description" content="Press Release
Distribution and Professional Authoring.">

Next take your key words and phrases and prepare a key word meta tag.  
Here's what that tag looks like on my press release page:

<meta name="keywords" content="press release, media, releases, news, professional writer, release, advertise, contact, public relations, newspaper, stories, web site,">

Search engines are funny things. Their rules and ranking procedures
change often. Generally speaking, however, if you include your key 
phrases in the page content, title, and meta tag descriptions, you'll
have the best chance of gaining and maintaining a high ranking.

Good luck!

Your Site Has Been Banned From Search Engine
---------------


Do you want your website banned from a search service? Of course not, no 
one does. But it happens every day to unsuspecting website owners. Why? 
Because "search engine" is a term loosely and incorrectly applied to all 
search services. And not all search services are search engines. There
are the "real" search engines and there are directories. So, what is the 
difference and why does it matter?

A "true" search engine is a robotic program that automatically 
crisscrosses the web retrieving and cataloging websites. A directory is a
search service powered by human beings, called guides or surfers, who 
review and rank websites.

While submitting the main URL and key pages of your website is accepted 
practice with "true" search engines, it is NOT tolerated with the 
directories. In fact, this practice is considered "spamming" by most 
directories and will likely get your site banned. Why? The people 
reviewing websites do not have time to review the same URL only to give 
it the same ranking.

I have divided the search engines and directories into three main 
categories below: "real" search engines, directories, and pay-for-listing
search services with submission tips for each.

TRUE SEARCH ENGINES
Submit your main URL and several key pages of your website to these
search engines as often as you like without penalty.

http://www.alltheweb.com/
http://www.altavista.com/
http://www.completeresults.com/
http://www.directhit.com/
http://www.excite.com/
http://www.google.com/
http://www.hotbot.com/
http://www.lycos.com
http://www.msn.com/
http://www.northernlight.com/
http://www.webcrawler.com

NOTE: Google and Direct Hit primarily use popularity to rank websites.

DIRECTORIES
Carefully read the submission guidelines for each directory before 
submitting your website.

Class A Directories
Submit only your main URL one time to these directories. Go.Com, Snap.Com
and Yahoo currently require the submitter to find the best category and 
sub-category for the site. For example, if you have a flower and gift 
website, you must choose ONE category for your on-line business: the
flower category OR the gift category. If you request information from 
Go.Com (Infoseek) on submitting your URL, you will get an autoresponder 
that states it is acceptable to submit your site once a month to keep it 
fresh, but that is risky. Better to be safe than sorry!

http://www.dmoz.com/ (Open Directory)
http://www.go.com/ (formerly Infoseek)
http://www.snap.com/
http://yahoo.com/

Class B Directories
You may submit your website to each relevant category one time. In the
gift and flower store example, you could submit your site once to the 
flower category and once to the gift category.

http://www.askjeeves.com/
http://www.looksmart.com/

Pay-For-Listing Search Services
These search services are different from the others in that they sell 
their listings. Companies with a few extra dollars can pay to get a 
higher ranking.

http://www.goto.com/ (GoTo is not related to Go, above.)
http://www.simplesearch.com/
http://findwhat.com/

While I hope this information is helpful, please read and follow the 
submission guidelines for each search service anyway. If you need more 
information on the search services, click over to the Search Engine 
Watch website at http://searchenginewatch.com. Good luck in your search 
engine battle!
