Free Tutorial Invitation
Dear Internet Friend,

Would you like to find out how to make a fortune with 
free ezine advertising?

If you aren't familiar with ezines, they are newsletters 
sent to you via email. There are over 90,000 of them.

But I'm NOT talking about writing your own ezine, 
unless YOU want to.  I'm talking about a very clever 
twist on using them that works insanely!  It's very 
simple. No rocket science here.  

Using this system you can:

  **Generate a huge flood of traffic within 24-72 hours.

  **Start almost right away. Virtually no learning curve -- 
  begin using my system within only a few hours of 
  receiving it.

  **Promote your business online with almost ZERO 
  cost over and over again, anytime you want.

  **Get at least 10 times better results than placing ads 
  in ezines without spending a dime.

  **Attain celebrity status that makes people want to 
  meet and do business with you.

  **Gain all the credibility for your product you could 
  possibly want.

Let me show you how simple my system really is.  To 
get the link to your FREE Ezine Tutorial, send an 
e-mail with the subject title "EzineInfo" to:
