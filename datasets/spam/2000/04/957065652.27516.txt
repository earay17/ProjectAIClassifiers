What better present for a Wesolowski than Wesolowski Music?
"Dr. W's Music for Relaxation" will relax your Wesolowski too.
Profiled  on the CP Wire Service,  Toronto Star, Web services, 
and played on radio, but you probably can't get it in a store.

Thoroughly Wesolowski tested and approved.
And, I ought to know.

Yours,
