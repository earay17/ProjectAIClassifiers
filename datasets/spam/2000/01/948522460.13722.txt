Copy of an e-mail sent by Boyd Munro to AOPA's President (Bill Hamilton) and
AOPA's Treasurer (Spencer Ferrier)

Dear Bill,

The following news item was reported by the ABC on 20th January

QUOTE (ABC, 20th January)

Pilots warned against early fuel compo claim

There has been a call for pilots or aircraft owners to wait until planes are
to ready to fly again before launching compensation claims over contaminated
fuel.

Some 5,000 small planes have been grounded until a cleaning process has been
found for their engines.

The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association says the main priority is to get
the planes flying.

The association's Mike Hart also says members should not join a proposed
class action by Sydney law firm Ebsworth and Ebsworth as the association has
another law firm on standby.

"This organisation is representing their interests and on that basis, given
the overwhelming response that we've had from people lodging indications,
that they will be seeking damages from Mobil with us," he said.

"It is appropriate that we coordinate in the interests of everybody in the
industry, not just a few who may think that there may be sort of financial
gain."

UNQUOTE

Bill, I commend you on the change in AOPA's handling of this matter.
Calming it down rather than stirring it up is certainly in the long-term
interests of AOPA's members.  This is a huge improvement in the position
AOPA was previously taking, as described by the Financial Review on 5th
January

QUOTE (Financial Review, 5th January)

Sydney law firm Ferrier and Associates is launching a potentially massive
legal action against Mobil Oil on behalf of pilots and general aviation
businesses hit by contaminated fuel supplied by the oil giant.

Lawyer Mr Spencer Ferrier, who is also a private pilot and treasurer of the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia, said yesterday that
AOPAA had begun collecting evidence on damage caused by the contaminated
fuel supplied by Mobil.

He said this would be used for a ``representative action" in the courts to
recover the damages suffered by aircraft owners and businesses harmed by an
almost total closure of general aviation activity over much of Australia.

UNQUOTE


I note what Mike said on the ABC yesterday about a few who may think there
may be some sort of financial gain in this.  I have one question.  What is
the name of the other law firm that AOPA has on standby?

Cheers,

Boyd
