With the constant need to maximise the efficiency of the workforce through 
multi-tasking (especially in the field of mechanical handling), the issues 
of safety and competence are more important than ever. 

The SAFETY AWARENESS HANDBOOKS AND VIDEOS are a cost-effective solution, 
allowing in-house training using your own safety personnel or third party 
trainer.

The HANDBOOKS are convenient pocket-sized (A6) booklets packed with safety 
information allowing for on-the-spot checking of safe practice. Widely 
used in the oil industry and regarded as the "industry standard" they are 
applicable to all areas of industry and commerce. (Currently issued to 
UK Health and Safety Inspectors as reference documents.)

The VIDEOS emphasise good practice and provide guidance on safety in an 
entertaining, but thorough way. Offering 15-20 minutes of viewing, well-known 
TV personalities are used in often humorous situations to reinforce the 
messages.

INTERNATIONAL in nature the Handbooks and Videos reference relevant legislation 
and industry standards. They are available in UK English, US English, Spanish, 
Russian and Portuguese. (More language options will follow in due course.)

Details of the products can be found at http://www.safety-at-work.co.uk 
together with a secure server for online ordering to protect your privacy. 

Sample pages from the handbooks and slide shows from the videos are also 
available on this web site.
