TREASURE MAP TO $440,000

If you will follow the directions on my map, you will discover over FOUR HUNDRED 
THOUSAND DOLLAR$!

Yes, there is a catch !!! Actually two catches...

One, you do have to follow the map, which is not rocket science; and two, you could lose 
as 
much as five $5 bills (a whopping $25 fortune) if you 
do not follow the map.

Golly Gee!  You knew it was too good to be true.  You have to follow directions and you 
have 
to risk your $25 life's savings.  See, you knew there 
was no free lunch!

Gosh, even to win the lottery you have to follow directions:  First you have to buy a lottery 
ticket... and then, if you win, you have to follow even 
more directions to collect your money!

HERE IS WHERE YOU START.  Click on your email reply button and send me the 
message 
"PLEASE SEND ME THE MAP"

I will send you the first half of the map for you to study with no obligation.  If you study the 
first 
part of the map and decide you have no further 
interest, just click "delete" and the Magic Dragon will return no more.  

HERE IS WHERE YOU START.  Click on your email reply button and send me the

Sincerely,
