How would you like to own a piece of an Exclusive Virtual Mall that is for members only?

This on-line mall is for members only but I happen to be a member and want to share this experience with all. I signed up and now already my first month I am starting to see some return income. 

This website was developed with the help of Microsoft and IBM and just opened in Sept of 1999. This mall got over 2 Millions hits it's first day on-line.

 You just have to check this out. You owe it to yourself.
The link I enclosed will get you there and if you are interested in becoming a member or would like to get a percentage of each sale made at that site from everyone you direct to shop there, just email me back.
I will be glad to answer any question you have and allow you to sign up and you can have your own account and start earning income today.

Here is the Site!   http://www.Quixtar.com

After you seen the site and if you  have any questions just email me back at this address,

Thanks

Your Friend.

Mike
