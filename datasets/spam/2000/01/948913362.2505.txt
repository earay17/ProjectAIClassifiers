What if I told you that I have been with this new, innovative, company for only three 
months and made $15,000 last month.  This is not a get rich quick scheme, I worked 
my butt of for it!

If you can spend one to three hours a day promoting this system, you too can make 
a very lucritave living.  As a matter of fact, it won't be long before you quit your 
present job to become the president of your own thriving company.  If I can do it, 
you can do it!

I'll see you at the bank,
