However if you are interested in finding out the secrets to success on the Internet then by all means READ very carefully!

The "net" has literally leveled the playing field, it has and will continue to take ordinary people like you and I to homebased incomes that are 
unheard of.

For very little money anyone can start a profitable internet business. All you really need is information! All the information is out there for the 
taking. The problem is that it could take many hours and days and months to get up to speed and you still may not get it right. That's where we 
come in.

We have put together 4 reports that are up to date--written in Jan,2000--these reports are a result of over 3 years of trial and error research, all 
the do's and don'ts of internet marketing. You can, for real be up and running making money in 48-72 hrs of reading these reports and if there is 
any unanswered questions you can get help via email at anytime.

HERE IS HOW TO GET THE REPORTS:

These reports where put together in a ( MBS ) Mutual Benefit Structure, Meaning, this is not MLM where it is all for one and one for themselves, 
or this is not networking where may the best MAN/WOMEN win. This is WIN-WIN, everyone wins, always! OR your money back no questions 
asked. 

The following four people have gone before you and know how to do this and will help you every step of the way, they can show you how to 
set up a web site quickly and economically, how to email for profit, how to create multiple income streams, and so much more! Here is what you 
need to do to be on their team.

Send $5.00 cash in US Funds or and I am not kidding here any currency that can easily be converted to US Funds $5.00 ( French francs, 
Swiss frans, German Marks, anything ) let's have fun watching this travel the Globe---only the "net" makes that possible!

To begin Marketing these reports yourself take out the name in the #1 spot and move everyone up 1 spot and put yourself in the #4 spot. Do 
not change this in any way, it will not work if you do. Remember Honesty, Integrity, and Dignity.
 
If you happen to not want to be involved with the Profit side of the business this is still $20.00 well spent, you can't find this information this easy 
or cheaply,and these 4 people will still help you anytime you need them, And finally you'll also be led to a website that it's only mission is to help 
you market your product or service.
